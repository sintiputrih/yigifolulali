Practice in health facilities that serve Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Work in an area with high staffing needs and in-demand disciplines.<h2>What percentage do you have to be to be considered Native American?</h2>The Bureau of Indian Affairs uses a blood quantum definition—generally one-fourth Native American blood—and/or tribal membership to recognize an individual as Native American. However, each tribe has its own set of requirements—generally including a blood quantum—for membership (enrollment) of individuals.<h2>How much Native American do I have to be?</h2>Most tribes require a specific percentage of Native “blood,” called blood quantum, in addition to being able to document which tribal member you descend from. Some tribes require as much as 25% Native heritage, and most require at least 1/16th Native heritage, which is one great-great grandparent.<h2>Can a DNA test tell if you are Native American?</h2>A DNA test may be able to tell you whether or not you're Indian, but it will not be able to tell you what tribe or nation your family comes from, and DNA testing is not accepted by any tribe or nation as proof of Indian ancestry.<h2>Are there scholarships for Native American students?</h2>To help provide financial support for students who identify as Native American, many colleges and private organizations offer Native American scholarships. These scholarships include full ride scholarships, awards that support Native American women, and other scholarships that are for minority students in general.<h2>What is the Native American scholarship?</h2>The Association on American Indian Affairs has been providing Native American student scholarships since 1947 and provides scholarships to undergraduate and graduate Native American students who are citizens/ members of their Tribal Nation – whether or not their Nation is recognized by the federal government.<h2>Can you get a scholarship for being Cherokee?</h2>The Cherokee Nation sponsors a wide range of scholarships for members of the tribe.

For people researching the potential of a Native American past, you can: Look at available immigration or census records.<h2>What percentage Cherokee Do you have to be for benefits?</h2>To give you an example, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians require a minimum of 1/16 degree of Cherokee Indian blood for tribal enrollment, while the Bureau of Indian Affairs' Higher Education Grant expects you to have the minimum of 1/4 Native American blood percentages.<h2>How much money do Native Americans get a month?</h2>Members of some Native American tribes receive cash payouts from gaming revenue. The Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians, for example, has paid its members $30,000 per month from casino earnings.
