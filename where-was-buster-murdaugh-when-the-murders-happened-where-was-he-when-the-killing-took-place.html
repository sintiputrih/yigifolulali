The two came to Alex the same night the killing took place.</strong></p><p><strong>Netflix</strong> has a strong history of creating engrossing, disturbing, and even downright irritating true crime documentaries and series, and one of their most recent is no exception. <strong>Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal</strong>&nbsp;focuses on the sequence of incidents that began with <strong>Mallory Beach</strong>‘s death and ultimately resulted in the downfall of the <strong>Murdaugh family</strong> heritage.</p><p>What began as an unfortunate accident at the hands of the scion of the prominent Murdaugh family turned out to be just one dot in a long series of deaths and financial crimes. <strong>Alex Murdaugh</strong>, who was found guilty of murder for the deaths of his own wife and son, <strong>Maggie</strong> and<strong> Paul Murdaugh</strong>, stands at the center of all the incidents.</p><p>Apart from Paul, Alex and Maggie also had another son, <strong>Buster Murdaugh</strong>, their eldest one. One thing many viewers want to know about Buster is where he was when the murders of his mother and brother happened. Well, let’s find it out together.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <strong>Alex Murdaugh’s weight loss</strong>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=buster-murdaugh-was-with-his-girlfriend-brooklynn-white-when-the-murders-happened></span>Buster Murdaugh Was With His Girlfriend, Brooklynn White, When the Murders Happened!<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Buster Murdaugh</strong> officially took the witness stand to give testimony in his father’s continuing double murder trial on February 21, 2023. He said that he and his longtime partner, <strong>Brooklynn White</strong>, were residing in South Carolina when the murders of his brother and mother happened.</p><p>Buster revealed in court that his father called him late the night the killing took place on June 7, 2021, and broke the tragic news of his mother and brother’s murders. He said,</p><p><strong>He asked me if I was sitting down, and I was like, yeah, then he sounded odd, then he told me that my mom and brother had been shot. Brooklynn, my girlfriend, was with me … she could hear my conversation over the phone, and she started packing stuff…I kinda just sat there for a minute, I was in shock. But, eventually, we got our stuff together and drove down to Moselle.</strong></p><p>Buster testified that he and Brooklynn arrived at the Moselle property late, possibly about two in the morning, though he couldn’t recall the exact time. He stated that his father, <strong>Alex</strong>, was “destroyed, heartbroken… just broken down,” and added that he was sobbing and unable to speak.</p><p>Buster also reported that numerous PMPED colleagues and friends attended and stayed for several hours. He, Alex, Brooklynn, and Uncle<strong> John Marvin</strong> eventually traveled to Alex’s parents’ house in Almeda and stayed there.</p><p>At the Moselle lodge, Buster remembers helping his father pack a suitcase of necessities from his wardrobe to take with them, adding that he stayed there for several days and kept a close eye on his father.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-is-buster-murdaugh-now></span>Where Is Buster Murdaugh Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of now, <strong>Buster Murdaugh </strong>lives in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, with his partner, lawyer <strong>Brooklynn White</strong>. What he does for a living is unknown. He appeared as a first witness for the defense in his father’s trial in February of this year, which means that he spoke on his father’s behalf.</p><p>In his testimony, he stated that<strong> Alex</strong> was “heartbroken” over the murders of his mother, <strong>Maggie</strong>, and brother, <strong>Paul</strong>. Buster has been present for the entire trial of his father, and according to Law & Crime, throughout the proceedings</p><p>Buster has reportedly been rattled and buried his head in his hands while the lawyers recount the graphic details of the double homicide. Buster’s father was found guilty of both murders on March 2nd, and on March 3rd, the judge gave him two consecutive life sentences in jail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYmr%2BmedaaqmaapajBpr6MpqyrnJGqtKl51qGcp2WknbJuudSrm56qo2K1orzPnqWenF2staa%2BxGaumqtdnbJuw8eepWasmJp6rLXLpaCnn12pvLC3jKmjmpuVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhere-was-buster-murdaugh-when-the-murders-happened-where-was-he-when-the-killing-took-place.html&text=Where%20Was%20Buster%20Murdaugh%20When%20the%20Murders%20Happened%3f%20Where%20Was%20He%20When%20the%20Killing%20Took%20Place%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-was-buster-murdaugh-when-the-murders-happened-where-was-he-when-the-killing-took-place.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-was-buster-murdaugh-when-the-murders-happened-where-was-he-when-the-killing-took-place.html&title=Where%20Was%20Buster%20Murdaugh%20When%20the%20Murders%20Happened%3f%20Where%20Was%20He%20When%20the%20Killing%20Took%20Place%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhere-was-buster-murdaugh-when-the-murders-happened-where-was-he-when-the-killing-took-place.html&title=Where%20Was%20Buster%20Murdaugh%20When%20the%20Murders%20Happened%3f%20Where%20Was%20He%20When%20the%20Killing%20Took%20Place%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-was-buster-murdaugh-when-the-murders-happened-where-was-he-when-the-killing-took-place.html&title=Where%20Was%20Buster%20Murdaugh%20When%20the%20Murders%20Happened%3f%20Where%20Was%20He%20When%20the%20Killing%20Took%20Place%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-was-buster-murdaugh-when-the-murders-happened-where-was-he-when-the-killing-took-place.html&description=Where%20Was%20Buster%20Murdaugh%20When%20the%20Murders%20Happened%3f%20Where%20Was%20He%20When%20the%20Killing%20Took%20Place%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mentor-support-queer-identity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Letter of Thanks to My Mentor for Supporting All of Me">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./elvis-presley-ethnicity-family-history-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Was His Ethnicity and Family History?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
