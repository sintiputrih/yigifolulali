The football star himself <a href=#>denied they were getting serious</a>.</p><p>In November 2023, the Kansas City Chief's tight-end was also seen wearing a T-shirt that said, "Crazy Horse 3 Las Vegas."

During an appearance on Mad Money on CNBC, Hunt said they were the "real deal" and that they were all "so happy" for the athlete. "Well, first of all, we're so happy for Travis Kelce and Taylor in their relationship. I've had a chance to meet her at one of the many games that she's attended this year," said the Chiefs' CEO.</p><p>He continued: "She's just as sweet as she can be. I also got to see her play here [at our Arrowhead Stadium] twice this past summer and what an incredible performer. I mean, just one of the most incredible artists of our time." So it's no wonder Swift "organically" increased their female audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's been a very interesting, very fun year having the two of them dating," Hunt explained. "The attention that's been focused on the Chiefs, our female audience has grown leaps and bounds. That's right, it was purely organic."</p><p>"You know, when they were just starting off dating, there were a lot of people saying, 'Oh, it's a marketing stunt,' but no, it's very real," Hunt said of Kelce and Swift's relationship.</p><p>In conclusion, the Chiefs' boss said "the most important thing is we're happy for the two of them."

In the video below, you can see the Lover songstress' expression change from proud to unsure. "Taylor swift definitely got the ick 3 seconds into travis kelce's speech," someone wrote on X (formerly Twitter).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another one noted: "Bro no way Travis Kelce just gave Taylor Swift the ick live in tv in front of millions of viewers.

"Taylor Swift fans saying she got the ick from Travis Kelce yelling 'Viva las vegas' over and over. Brother, If I won a superbowl I'd be up there with my shirt off and slapping my balls on the mic for all I care," said a netizen.</p><p>Dr. Louise Mahler, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a body language expert, also weighed in on the issue</a>, saying that the 14-time Grammy winner was "embarrassed" and was "being polite" throughout the viral footage.</p><p>"We can imagine how anyone super excited may have expressed themselves like this, but I think she was horrified, slightly amused, but embarrassed," the body language expert said of Swift's "ick" moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mahler added: "When one sees Taylor Swift at the Grammys [you can tell] she is totally elated by her colleagues' wins. She jumps up and down and laughs and calls out. In this footage, she opens, then shuts and holds her mouth tightly. She does not want to open it, suggesting she does not want to say something. Her mouth is slightly smiling, but her eyes lose their sparkle. She is being polite."</p><p>The Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl win might have just proved that <a href=#>the "Taylor Swift Curse"</a> isn't real.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lkWLDprPArGSsrKKevW6vy66ZZqqVnMKtrdFmrqGhnJp6pa3ToqWgZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftravis-kelce-a-vegas-strip-club-regular-while-dating-taylor-swift.html&text=Is%20Travis%20Kelce%20A%20Vegas%20Strip%20Club%20Regular%20While%20Dating%20Taylor%20Swift%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftravis-kelce-a-vegas-strip-club-regular-while-dating-taylor-swift.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-a-vegas-strip-club-regular-while-dating-taylor-swift.html&title=Is%20Travis%20Kelce%20A%20Vegas%20Strip%20Club%20Regular%20While%20Dating%20Taylor%20Swift%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftravis-kelce-a-vegas-strip-club-regular-while-dating-taylor-swift.html&title=Is%20Travis%20Kelce%20A%20Vegas%20Strip%20Club%20Regular%20While%20Dating%20Taylor%20Swift%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftravis-kelce-a-vegas-strip-club-regular-while-dating-taylor-swift.html&title=Is%20Travis%20Kelce%20A%20Vegas%20Strip%20Club%20Regular%20While%20Dating%20Taylor%20Swift%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftravis-kelce-a-vegas-strip-club-regular-while-dating-taylor-swift.html&description=Is%20Travis%20Kelce%20A%20Vegas%20Strip%20Club%20Regular%20While%20Dating%20Taylor%20Swift%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./melissa-gilbert-and-rob-lowe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Melissa Gilbert and Rob Lowe">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-add-a-light.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Install a Light Fixture (DIY)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
