In this article, we will explore the top 10 male UFC fighters of all time, considering their accomplishments, skill sets, and impact on the sport.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>1. Anderson Silva</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Anderson Silva is widely regarded as one of the greatest fighters in UFC history. The Brazilian fighter held the Middleweight Championship for nearly seven years, defending his title a record-breaking 10 times.

Demetrious Johnson</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Demetrious "Mighty Mouse" Johnson is widely regarded as the best flyweight fighter in UFC history.
