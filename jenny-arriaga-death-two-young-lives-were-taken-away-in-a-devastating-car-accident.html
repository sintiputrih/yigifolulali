Among the victims was 20-year-old Jenny Arriaga, a psychology student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This article pays homage to her life and legacy, attempting to capture the essence of a vibrant young woman whose journey was cut prematurely short.</p><p>Jenny Arriaga was a beacon of hope and ambition in her community. At just 20 years old, she had already carved out a path for herself, pursuing a degree in psychology at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Known for her infectious laugh, radiant personality, and unyielding dedication to her studies, Jenny was a beloved figure among her peers and faculty. She showed promise in her academic pursuits, with dreams of using her degree to help others and make a positive impact on society.</p><p>On a fateful evening, Jenny and her friend, Lester Juarez, also a junior at the university studying construction management, were involved in a catastrophic car crash. The details surrounding the incident are still under investigation, but it has been confirmed that both Jenny and Lester succumbed to their injuries at the scene.</p><p>Cassie Heier</p><p>This is such sad news to hear this morning…praying for their sweet babies. Jenny Arriaga was in my esti class and while I can’t say we were close she was such a beautiful soul. Definitely didn’t deserve this building a life as a mother and business owner 💔</p><p>The city was left reeling when news broke about the tragic accident that claimed the lives of Jenny and Lester. Both students, full of potential and dreams, had their lives abruptly ended due to this unfortunate incident. The cause of the crash is still under investigation, but early reports suggest a collision with another vehicle.</p><p>Jenny Arriaga’s untimely death is a profound loss, not only to her family and friends but also to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln community and the city of Lincoln. She was a bright, ambitious young woman whose passion for psychology and helping others shone through in everything she did. Her loss leaves a void that cannot be filled, a stark reminder of a promising life cut short.</p><p><strong>Brian Aguilar</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/oxgaps.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ezgif.com-gif-maker-2023-11-26T161713.895-edited.webp><p>Man, I’ve had a heavy heart all day with this news of losing a real friend/brother Lezter Juarez. This man was so genuine and just wanted to see all his ppl win no matter what. He would always ask how my coaching stuff is going, how Shoot 360 stuff is going and was always so hype for me about anything good. Was always there about anything bad or tough. Just a true friend man. A true friend that I’ll always be so grateful to have grown close to especially this past year. My man became one of “the boys” and was always down to hang out. We never had a dull moment , we was always laughing and always just on BS living life and having fun. I’m truly lucky to have crossed paths with Lezter man, and was lucky to be able to call him a friend. My heart and prayers go out to both families of Lezter and Jenny Arriaga and especially to my guy Robinson Juarez. Family and friends, please donate to their go fund me if you are able, to help take care of funeral expenses. Anything will help. You can donate here: https://gofund.me/9d0bafae</p><p>Jenny’s memory lives on in the hearts of those who knew and loved her. Her legacy will continue to inspire future generations of students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, reminding them of the fragility of life and the importance of living each day to the fullest.</p><p>In closing, we extend our deepest condolences to Jenny Arriaga’s family and friends during this difficult time. As we mourn her passing, we also celebrate her life, cherishing the memories and contributions she made during her short time with us. Her spirit will continue to live on, a testament to a life well-lived, albeit far too short.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmanBrbHHqKysnV6asbZ61admo52eo8ZurdGroJqfkWKxpq3ToWStr59ixrDBzaBkpaGmmsBuw8SrnGaskaCyr3nAsJiyZZmjeqJ5w56tmquklsGqusZmmpqqXZawpLXDnqWtZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjenny-arriaga-death-two-young-lives-were-taken-away-in-a-devastating-car-accident.html&text=Jenny%20Arriaga%20Death%3a%20Two%20Young%20Lives%20were%20taken%20away%20in%20a%20Devastating%20Car%20Accident&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjenny-arriaga-death-two-young-lives-were-taken-away-in-a-devastating-car-accident.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjenny-arriaga-death-two-young-lives-were-taken-away-in-a-devastating-car-accident.html&title=Jenny%20Arriaga%20Death%3a%20Two%20Young%20Lives%20were%20taken%20away%20in%20a%20Devastating%20Car%20Accident" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjenny-arriaga-death-two-young-lives-were-taken-away-in-a-devastating-car-accident.html&title=Jenny%20Arriaga%20Death%3a%20Two%20Young%20Lives%20were%20taken%20away%20in%20a%20Devastating%20Car%20Accident" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjenny-arriaga-death-two-young-lives-were-taken-away-in-a-devastating-car-accident.html&title=Jenny%20Arriaga%20Death%3a%20Two%20Young%20Lives%20were%20taken%20away%20in%20a%20Devastating%20Car%20Accident" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjenny-arriaga-death-two-young-lives-were-taken-away-in-a-devastating-car-accident.html&description=Jenny%20Arriaga%20Death%3a%20Two%20Young%20Lives%20were%20taken%20away%20in%20a%20Devastating%20Car%20Accident" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./149856-kerry-washingtons-rarely-seen-husband-nn-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kerry Washington's Rarely Seen Husband Nnamdi Asomugha Spotted at Met Gala">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./uzo-aduba-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-109503-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Uzo Aduba Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
