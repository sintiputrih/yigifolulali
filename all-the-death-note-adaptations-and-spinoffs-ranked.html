In fact, one would be hard-pressed to find someone in the anime community who hasn’t, at the very least, heard good things about it, or seen it recommended online. Since the manga’s debut in 2003, Light Yagami’s journey to becoming the god of the New World has become a smashing success, eventually making it to the list of the best-selling manga of all time, with 30 million copies in circulation.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=511 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>In the years following the manga’s conclusion in 2006, the adaptations, remakes, and spinoffs came pouring in, to the delight of fans around the globe, desperate to consume any type of Death Note-related content they can get their hands on. Naturally, it should go without saying that not all adaptations are necessarily good or even worth people’s time. To help fans decide which remakes to dive into first, here is a ranking of all the franchise’s screen and stage adaptations and spin-offs.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>10. The Man Who Was Made a Fool by L the Most — Detective Matsuda’s Case File (2007)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=736 data-current-count=1036 data-injectable=true>Also known simply as Matsuda’s Spin-off, this is a 16-minute short film that is considered part of the Death Note live-action film trilogy. Originally, some of the scenes were included in L: Change the World, but were later cut and released in Japan as its own piece of media, with additional scenes being filmed for that solo purpose. Needless to say, while the film offers some insight into Matsuda’s feelings in the aftermath of the Kira case, it’s far from a must-watch and a rather unnecessary spin-off (it was cut for a reason, after all). For Matsuda enthusiasts and Death Note fans in general, this might feel true to the character, but there’s no denying that it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of quality.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Death Note (2017)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>By now, it’s common knowledge that North American companies love to put their own spin on every successful piece of foreign media they can find. In 2017, Netflix did it with Death Note, and while it has better quality than other movies in the franchise, as an adaptation it falls completely flat. The movie has been torn apart by critics and audience members alike, not only for having a weak script but for the way it fundamentally changes the core of the characters it’s trying to adapt.</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>In this version of the story, instead of being the mastermind manipulator with a god complex that attracted so many to the protagonist, Light is a bullied teen, eager to expose his biggest secret for the sake of earning his crush’s attention. That, along with the film’s unwelcomed focus on a romance that wasn’t there to begin with, makes Netflix’s adaptation one the worst in the Death Note franchise. Not satisfied with one, though, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix has confirmed a sequel</a> to this North American remake.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. <strong>Death Note: New Generation (2016)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Death Note: New Generation is a three-episode mini-series, meant to close the bridge between the events of L: Change the World, and Death Note: Light up the New World. It sets the stage for a new game of chess between L’s successor, Ryuzaki, and the one responsible for the recently resurfaced Kira murders.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>Unlike Netlifx’s remake, which attempts to slap new personalities and motivations on well-loved characters, New Generation offers an original continuation of Death Note’s story, with fresh characters reminiscent of their old equivalents. That said, although the series is worth a watch&nbsp;(particularly for additional background on the sequel), it doesn’t live up to expectations.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Death Note: Light up the New World (2016)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=688 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Set 10 years after the first live-action, this film centers around the concept of six new deadly notebooks that have somehow made their way to the human realm. Even after Light’s demise, Kira’s murderous legacy continues on, and terror — or justice, depending on who you ask — is once again being spread by someone known as Neo Kira. It’s now up to Ryuzaki and the new Kira Task Force to apprehend the new Death Note users.</p><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>While it doesn’t quite gather the same level of hype as other adaptations, the consensus is that Light up the New World is still a better movie than Netflix’s Death Note. It offers just enough nostalgic elements for fans of the franchise to pore over, while taking the story in a new direction that feels true to the tone of the Death Note universe. Unfortunately, though, no sequel can live up to the standard set by the original story, meaning that L and Light’s absence leaves a huge gaping hole in the hearts of viewers.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. L: Change the World (2008)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=true>While Light is an extremely interesting character, both from a psychological and moral viewpoint, L is a very close second, and a fan-favorite. It comes as little surprise, then, that a movie focused on the world’s greatest detective would find its audience. Naturally, the casting of Kenichi Matsuyama to play L helps things along, as the actor gives one of the best live-action portrayals of the character we have seen thus far.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>While the story is entertaining enough, there’s no denying that L: Change the World lacks a bit of what makes Death Note stand out, — i.e., the complex mind games between its two main characters. In this side-story about bioterrorism set 23 days before L’s death, the detective is forced to carry out the whole movie by himself, which, despite granting viewers a better insight into the character, ends up being lackluster compared to other installments in the franchise.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Death Note: The Musical (2015)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=820 data-injectable=true>In 2015, Death Note was brought to the stage in the form of a musical adaptation. The show ran in Japan and South Korea throughout that year, before making comebacks in 2017, early 2020, and 2022 due to popular demand. Despite its songs having been originally written and recorded in English, the show is yet to make its debut on Western soil. Nevertheless, those who have watched this stage play praise it for capturing the characters’ essence, the incredibly catchy tunes, and the cast’s strong vocal performances.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Naturally, it might be a little unfair to compare a musical to TV shows and movies, but even so, this adaptation has what it takes to stand tall against some of the competition. If only the staging had a bit more to offer visually and the story wasn’t so condensed, Death Note: The Musical could have ranked higher on this list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Death Note (2015)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=630 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=767 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>A musical wasn’t the only new project Death Note fans were graced with in 2015. This 11-episode Japanese TV drama series is a good retelling of the story and is very well-liked among fans, particularly for shining a brighter light on the protagonist’s quasi-friendship with the detective sworn to uncover his murders. To cram such a long story into so few episodes, changes had to naturally be made, and like with anything, some of those raised a few eyebrows. The decision to make Light a fan of Misa who tries to save her life, and the choice to make Near and Mello the same character with two personalities, for example, were nothing short of questionable, but overall, the narrative works. Of all Death Note adaptations, this is one of the most enjoyable.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Death Note (2006)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>This live-action movie was among the first Death Note adaptations to hit the screen, and for that, it holds a special place in fans’ hearts. The film adapts the first part of the beloved story, making it the first installment in the Japanese Death Note movie franchise. This movie has all the good stuff that makes this story a success: intensity, rivalry, moral complexity, and enough turns to keep viewers engaged.</p><p data-characters=509 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>Granted, there are a few alterations to the source material, but because the characters’ core remains the same, in this case, it works in the film’s favor, keeping the narrative feeling fresh enough to deal even hardcore fans a few surprises and ending on a satisfying cliffhanger. It’s worth mentioning that the special effects in this adaptation leave something to be desired, but in the grand scheme of things, this 2006 movie remains one of the better versions of the story we all know and love.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Death Note 2: The Last Name (2007)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=641 data-current-count=941 data-injectable=true>It’s not often that a sequel gathers more success than its predecessor, but Death Note 2: The Last Name does exactly that. In it, a third key chess piece enters Light and L’s game, heightening the intensity of the first movie, and finishing the story with a bang. Captivating from start to finish, this film embodies everything the franchise represents and is an absolute must for fans looking to explore slightly different versions of the events they’re familiar with. Of course, The Last Name is not a perfect adaptation, but despite its flaws, it still managed to claw its way into fans’ hearts and toward the top of this ranking.</p><h2 id=h-1-death-note-2006-2007 data-injectable=false>1. Death Note (2006-2007)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>Without a shred of doubt, the anime adaptation of Death Note is the best and most beloved version of the story. Across 37 episodes, the viewers are treated to the most accurate portrayal of the original manga, which focuses on the most interesting cat-and-mouse game in anime history. Not only does this version offer incredible insights into its main character’s thought processes and motivations, but it also does a great job depicting the complex dynamic between L and Light.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Naturally, part of the anime’s success can be attributed to it having an appropriate run time, which allows the narrative to breathe and does away with shortcuts to key plot points. Additionally, it’s safe to say that animation is the ideal medium to portray the story, perfectly blending Death Note‘s supernatural elements into the human realm. Not to mention, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anime’s soundtrack</a> is pretty iconic, too.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>With so many remakes already out in the world, it’s hard to believe there’s a need for more, but it’s unlikely that entertainment companies will back down. Fans can only wait and see what awaits them next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6ao6VlpJ2ybrDEmquhZZ6kwaZ5wJ2YqayRqbawutJmmKecXai9qrrOn52sZaKWu6yxw2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fall-the-death-note-adaptations-and-spinoffs-ranked.html&text=All%20the%20Death%20Note%20adaptations%20and%20spin-offs%2c%20ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-the-death-note-adaptations-and-spinoffs-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-death-note-adaptations-and-spinoffs-ranked.html&title=All%20the%20Death%20Note%20adaptations%20and%20spin-offs%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fall-the-death-note-adaptations-and-spinoffs-ranked.html&title=All%20the%20Death%20Note%20adaptations%20and%20spin-offs%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-death-note-adaptations-and-spinoffs-ranked.html&title=All%20the%20Death%20Note%20adaptations%20and%20spin-offs%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-the-death-note-adaptations-and-spinoffs-ranked.html&description=All%20the%20Death%20Note%20adaptations%20and%20spin-offs%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mama-mia-spicy-meatball-soup.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Healthy Turkey Meatball Soup  Modern Honey">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-challenge-babies-which-mtv-stars-have-given-birth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'The Challenge' Babies: Which MTV Stars Have Given Birth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
