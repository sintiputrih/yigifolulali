Danny has been able to land a number of other acting roles since then.</p><p>While he's really early in his career, Griffin has already worked with some of the greatest talents in the industry. In 2019, he featured in the film The Gentlemen (2019), starring <strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong> and <strong>Colin Farrell</strong>.</p><p>There remains little doubt this list will only grow longer as Danny gains further stardom in his profession. Eventually, the actor could also become one of the household names.</p><p>Meanwhile, fans are curious to learn if this handsome actor is dating someone special. Does he have a girlfriend?

Some users take years to get 1,000 followers on Instagram.</p><p>Despite being in the early phase of his career, Danny's still accumulated a decent amount of fans online. He currently <a href=# rel=noopener>boasts over 32k followers</a> on the picture-sharing platform.</p><p><strong>You Might Like: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Rege-Jean Page Girlfriend (Update) – Phoebe Dynevor Dating Rumor Addressed by the Actor</a></strong></p><p>Griffin obviously boasts all the attributes of a superstar, but he appears to have little interest in shedding light on his personal life as he seems to be quite a low-key guy.</p><p>While he's often active in social media, he doesn't share anything about his private life. So, even if he's dating a girlfriend right now, it's not come to light in the public.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p>Griffin doesn't do a lot of interviews, either.
