Marlene is the closest grandparent, with Alexei’s family still living in Israel — but that may change soon. <b>The couple has filed for Alexei’s family to come to America from Israel</b>, and during the transition, they’ll live with the couple.</strong></p><p>Regarding this, Why do they call him baby Boten?</p><p>All throughout the pregnancy, the 90 Day Fiance couple referred to their baby boy as “Baby Boten,” with “boten” meaning “peanut” in Hebrew. The couple made a similar announcement to introduce the name of their now one-year-old son, Shai, a week after his birth in April 2020.</p><p>Then What does Alexei and Loren do for a living? Alex worked as a medic in his native country of Israel before he moved to the United States to be with Loren and obtained his citizenship in January 2020. It seems he pursued a similar career as an essential worker in America, as he left the house to report to work amid the lockdown in Hollywood, Florida.</p><p>Where is Alexei and Loren now?</p><p>Loren Goldstone & Alexei Brovarnik</p><p>The duo had two wedding ceremonies, one in the U.S. and another in Israel, and now live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In April 2020, Us exclusively broke the news that Loren gave birth to the couple’s first child, son Shai.</p><p>Subsequently, Why did Loren have cesarean? During Loren’s doctor’s visit, the doctor says her second child is bigger than her first son, Shai, and that her cervix is very short. Loren explains to cameras that she had an abdominal cerclage put in years ago, a medical procedure that’s performed to prevent second trimester miscarriages and early delivery.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Loren_and_Alexei_name_their_second_son></span><strong>What did Loren and Alexei name their second son?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Loren and Alexei welcomed Asher, their second son, in August 2021.
