He was the 36th overall pick. Following his entry into the NFL, Carr’s career quickly progressed. It did not take long for him to win over the hearts of his team’s passionate fanbase.&nbsp;</p><p>By 2022, Carr landed a $125.5 million three-year contract thanks to his skills and execution. He is currently the quarterback for the Las Vegas Raiders.&nbsp;When he is not on the field, Carr, a doting husband, can be found at home with his wife, Heather Neel, and their kids.</p><p>Keep reading to learn more about her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/neelcarr-fotor-20230720114314.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Heather_Neel></span>Who Is Heather Neel?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Heather Neel is famously known as Derek Carr’s wife. However, she also has a career of her own. The gorgeous woman was born in Northern California on January 3, 1990. She attended Fresno Christian High School and graduated with a Bachelor’s degree from Western Colorado University.</p><p>Neel is very socially oriented and often posts cute pictures of herself and her husband on and off the field. She married Carr in 2012, so she is best known as Carr’s wife among sporting fans. Outside sporting circles, Neel is a social media influencer with a considerable following on Instagram, where she shares adorable posts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Heather_Neel_and_Derek_Carr></span>Heather Neel and Derek Carr<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carr and Neel’s romance goes way back to when they were just college students at Fresno State. However, the couple did not meet until he entered her workplace at BJ’s Brewhouse during his sophomore year. Neel was working one of her shifts at the time, and Carr had entered as a customer and engaged her in a conversation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/amcarr-fotor-20230720114441-1024x512.jpg><p>Neel <a href=#>recalled</a> the encounter in an old interview: “I had like diamond earrings in my ear, and I had them both. I knew I did. And he said, ‘Why are you only wearing one earring?’ And it made me check my ears. And I was like, ‘That’s your pickup line?’ [It worked] it did work. I talked to him.”</p><p>After that first meeting, Neel and Carr started dating, and soon after, they married. It was a great decision for Carr because, after the wedding, he went on to have two of his best seasons, scoring 87 touchdown passes against 15 interceptions for the Bulldogs, helping them set a 20-6 record.</p><p>Those two seasons put Carr on the radar and eventually got him drafted by the Raiders in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Heather_Neel_Kids></span>Heather Neel Kids&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Neel and her husband Carr have welcomed four children in their years together. Their children include Dallas, Deker, Deakon, and Brooklyn.</p><p>Unfortunately, parenthood started with a crisis for Carr and Neel as their son Dallas had to undergo three emergency surgeries mere days after his birth.&nbsp;</p><p>Carr once rehashed the experience: “I’ve been around nieces and nephews, and I’ve seen them throw up. But he started throwing up this dark green,” he said. “He was laying in his little bassinet, and it was shooting out to the floor.”</p><p>Twelve hours later, Dallas received emergency surgery to correct his tangled intestines at Children’s Hospital Central California. He returned for another surgery the second time he visited the hospital and did so again two weeks later.&nbsp;</p><p>It worked, and Dallas has been able to live a happy and healthy life.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Heather_Neel_Career></span>Heather Neel Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before meeting Carr, Heather Neel held down a job as a waitress at a steakhouse. She has since morphed into a social media influencer and model. Besides her job as an influencer, Neel manages the merchandise website DC4merchandise.com.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Heather_Neels_Net_Worth></span>Heather Neel’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Neel’s net worth is currently unknown. However, she enjoys a luxurious lifestyle thanks to her husband’s net worth. The NFL star is said to be worth a whopping $85 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Heather_Neel_Age></span>Heather Neel Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Neel was born on January 3, 1990, which makes her 33 years old in January 2023.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Heather_Neel_Instagram></span>Heather Neel Instagram<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Neel’s Instagram username is @heathercarr4.
