Not only does Levine boast being the lead singer of the band Maroon 5 — who probably should’ve dissolved into obscurity when the Black Eyed Peas were still dominating the music charts — but he also seems very proud of the tattoos that have united people from all walks of life in their shared hatred. Even Ben Affleck’s infamous back tattoo of a phoenix would weep at the stereotypical nature of the ink-based body art.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Comedian Matt Fernandez probably put it best when he said: “Adam Levine’s tattoos look like he just goes to a tattoo parlor and says ‘One tattoo please.'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Adam Levine's tattoos look like he just goes to a tattoo parlor and says "One tattoo please." <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yLY5kPM5fk</a></p>— Matt Fernandez (@FattMernandez) <a href=#>February 4, 2019</a></figure><h2 id=h-california data-injectable=false>‘California’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-facebook wp-block-embed-facebook" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=924 data-injectable=true>Back when Levine performed at the Super Bowl a few years back he did so without a shirt on, in a wardrobe choice that we assume was upon his insistence. After the show, Levine’s “California” tattoo on his belly instantly became a meme for many, with a ton of men across the country taking to writing their own home state on their stomachs to mock him, such as the Santa Clause one above, featuring a portly man who wrote “North Pole” on his bowl full of jelly. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CountryLiving</a> created an entire roundup of similar images, taken from the Facebook page Real Men In America, if you want to see more.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>‘Los Angeles’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Adam Levine (@adamlevine)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>In case you needed to get even more specific with where Levine calls home for himself, the singer has penned a veritable address book on himself by sporting another tattoo on his upper right arm that says “Los Angeles.” Levine told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> that the tattoo was a “Simple case of hometown love.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dove</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Adam Levine (@adamlevine)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>Levine’s very first tattoo was reportedly that of a dove on his upper left arm in memoriam of 9/11 when he was just 21 years of age. “I felt this needed to say something with this peaceful thing on my body,” Levine told People.

Levine has one-upped the actor in terms of picking an image straight out of a generic tattoo book to grace his back. In what looks like a lightly remixed version of the Starbucks logo, the image of a mermaid holding a skull with a pirate ship in the background reportedly took the singer six months of sessions to complete.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>‘Mom’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-110.png><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>If you thought Levine’s tattoos were original up to this point, that’s likely all about to change once you see the cliche image donning the singer’s right wrist.

And while we’re not saying it’s an absolute crime for an English speaker to get a tattoo of anything other than English on their body, it does scream “hipster” to a nauseating degree to see a Sanskrit phrase tattooed on Levine’s upper left chest in what is reportedly his homage to yoga.
