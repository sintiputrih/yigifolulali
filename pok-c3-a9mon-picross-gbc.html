A <i>picross</i>, from <i>picture</i> and <i>crossword</i>, is a genre of puzzle games, also known as a <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:nonogram>nonogram</a>. It was developed by <a href=# title="Jupiter Corporation">Jupiter Corporation</a>.</p><p>While it was announced in various game magazines in Spring 1999, the game never officially released.</p><p>In September 2020, a prototype ROM of the game was posted online. Despite being a prototype, the ROM is fully playable from start to end, and even includes credits.</p><p>The game includes 217 puzzles, with each of the 151 Pokémon species from <a href=# title="Generation I">Generation I</a> receiving at least one dedicated puzzle. <a href=# title="Togepi (Pokémon)">Togepi</a> from <a href=# title="Generation II">Generation II</a> also makes an appearance.</p><p>There are also several references to the <a href=# title="Original series">original series</a> of <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Pokémon the Series">Pokémon the Series</a>: some puzzles recreate iconic scenes, and some characters' appearance or mannerisms resemble their anime incarnations.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Gameplay>Gameplay</span></h2><p>Pokémon Picross is a nonogram puzzle game where players are presented with a grid of squares, and tasked with using a hammer and chisel to punch out the correct squares to reveal a solution image. Number clues are displayed on the outer edges of the grid's rows and columns, offering information as to how many squares should be punched out per row or column.</p><p>Each square can be either punched out, revealing a piece of the image beneath; or marked with an X, indicating that the square should not be punched out. Once all of the correct squares have been punched out (marking all "X" squares is not necessary), the puzzle will be considered complete - the solution image will be zoomed out, gain color, and display its name.</p><p>However, unlike traditional nonogram puzzles, the punched-out squares do not themselves form an image - instead, they reveal a layer below the grid that contains the outline of the image.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Puzzles>Puzzles</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/5/5a/PicrossGBCPuzzle.png decoding=async width=160 height=144 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Puzzle gameplay with Pikachu as the partner. <i>Main article: <a href=# title="Puzzle (Picross GBC)">Puzzle (Picross GBC)</a></i><p>The game features 217 puzzles divided into 15 areas.</p><p>At the start of a puzzle, the player is offered a hint - if they accept it, they then must time two button presses to determine one row and one column of squares that will each have their solutions revealed. After this (or declining the hint), the puzzle will begin a countdown timer depending on its size:</p><ul><li>10×10 puzzle: 20 minutes</li><li>15×15 puzzle: 30 minutes</li><li>20×20 puzzle: 70 minutes</li><li>30×30 puzzle: 90 minutes</li></ul><p>Additional hints can be requested from the pause menu, however each will deduct 5 minutes from the puzzle's timer.</p><p>If a square is incorrectly punched out, it will be automatically corrected to an X, but time will be deducted from the puzzle's timer. The time penalty will increase with the amount of mistakes in a single puzzle attempt:</p><ul><li>First mistake: -1 minute</li><li>Second mistake: -2 minutes</li><li>Third mistake: -4 minutes</li><li>Fourth mistake and onwards: -8 minutes</li></ul><p>However, squares incorrectly marked with an X will not be corrected, and will not incur a time penalty.</p><p>If a puzzle's timer reaches zero, whether naturally or through penalties, the attempt is considered a failure and the player will need to try the puzzle again from scratch.</p><p>A tutorial on puzzle mechanics is available in the "Tutorial" option in the game's main menu, and is narrated by <a href=# title="Professor Oak">Professor Oak</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Four-quadrant_puzzles>Four-quadrant puzzles</span></h3><p>10×10 and 15×15 puzzles are played on one screen, while 20×20 puzzles are played as four separate 10×10 quadrants, each with their own separate number clues. 30×30 puzzles play similarly, as four separate 15×15 quadrants.</p><p>The top-left quadrant is always the first quadrant the player must solve.</p><p>When a quadrant is solved, the overall timer will pause, and the quadrant will display its own solve time instead. The player is then prompted to choose any of the four quadrants to attempt next. If an already-solved quadrant is selected, then it can be re-attempted for a better solve time without resetting the other quadrants. However, this retry feature is disabled for puzzles appearing in area 8 onwards, as well as the safari area.</p><p>Once all four quadrants have been solved, the overall puzzle will be considered solved.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Safari_Puzzles>Safari Puzzles</span></h3><p>The "Safari Picross" mode makes several changes to the rules:</p><ul><li>The maximum time limit for each puzzle is reduced by 10 minutes.</li><li>Puzzles will not offer a hint at the start, nor can hints be requested. Incorrect punch-outs will still incur time penalties, as normal.</li><li>The hint option in the pause menu is replaced by "?start". When this is enabled, incorrectly-punched-out squares will neither be corrected nor incur a time penalty. When the mode is disabled, the player may choose to keep or discard the changes they made while in the mode.<ul><li>If the changes are kept, then they are saved to the grid's current state. Any incorrectly-punched-out squares will be corrected and incur time penalties, as usual.</li><li>If the changes are discarded, then the grid will return to its state from before the mode was enabled.</li><li>If the changes would result in the puzzle being correctly solved, then the mode is automatically disabled, and the puzzle will immediately be considered solved.</li></ul></li><li>On four-quadrant puzzles, the player is not notified when a quadrant is correctly solved. Instead, they will only be notified once all four quadrants are correctly solved. As a result, the current quadrant must be manually switched by the player, and the switch can be performed at any time.</li></ul><p>A tutorial explaining some of these changes is available under "Safari Tutorial", and is narrated by <a href=# title=Bill>Bill</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Map>Map</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/2/29/PicrossGBCAreaMap.png decoding=async width=160 height=144 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> An area map with puzzles.<p>Upon completing a puzzle, it will be marked with a <a href=# title="Poké Ball (item)">Poké Ball</a> icon on the map screen. If the puzzle was completed within the puzzle's specific "par time", then it will be marked with a Great Ball instead. During a puzzle attempt, if the remaining time is still within par range, the puzzle's timer will use white text; if the par period has passed, the timer will play a sound cue and then switch to black text.</p><ul><li>When playing on a Game Boy or a Super Game Boy, Poké Balls will instead render as a ball with two light halves (resembling a <a href=# title="Premier Ball">Premier Ball</a>, which did not debut until <a href=# title="Generation III">Generation III</a>), while Great Balls will render as a ball with a dark upper half and light lower half.</li></ul><p>Selecting an unsolved puzzle on the map will instantly start it. Selecting an already-completed puzzle will offer the choice to replay the puzzle or view the puzzle's "data" - its entry in the Pokédex or gallery.</p><p>The game is divided into 15 areas, with most areas containing 15 puzzles each. The first 14 puzzles in each area may be attempted in any order, but the 15th puzzle can only be played once at least 8 different puzzles in that area have been marked with a Great Ball. To unlock the next area, at least 8 puzzles in the current area must be solved with at least a Poké Ball.</p><ul><li>Area 0 is the sole area in the "Easy Picross" mode, and features a tutorial from <a href=# title=Misty>Misty</a> regarding generic map mechanics.</li><li>Areas 1-10 are located in the "Pokémon Picross" mode, and must be completed in sequence.<ul><li>Area 10 includes an additional 16th puzzle, which becomes available after all 150 previous Pokédex-eligible puzzles have been completed.</li></ul></li><li>Completing 8 puzzles in area 10 unlocks the "Safari Picross" mode, which includes 4 areas.<ul><li>Safari areas 1-3 only require 4 puzzles to be solved with a Great Ball to unlock the 15th puzzle. However, unlocking the next area still requires solving 8 puzzles with at least a Poké Ball.</li><li>Safari area 4 includes only 6 puzzles. The sixth puzzle appears after completing two puzzles in that area with a Great Ball.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9dex_and_galleries></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokédex_and_galleries>Pokédex and galleries</span></h3><p>Most puzzles in the game each represent a Pokémon. Completing a Pokémon's puzzle will add them to the Pokédex, where their completed image can be viewed, their cry can be played, and their puzzle can be jumped to in order to retry it.</p><ul><li>Puzzles in area 0 instead feature items or objects, and are thus not added to the Pokédex when solved. There is also no central gallery to view all of area 0's puzzles at once - their entries can only be viewed one at a time from the map.</li><li>Puzzles in Safari areas are added to the Safari gallery instead.</li><li><a href=# title="Pikachu (Pokémon)">Pikachu</a>'s Pokédex entry uses its cry from <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Pokémon the Series">Pokémon the Series</a>, voiced by <a href=# title="Ikue Otani">Ikue Otani</a>.</li></ul><p>Puzzles that have been completed with a Great Ball will display a grayscale Poké Ball icon next to their name in their respective galleries.</p><p>The Pokédex will initially list 150 slots for entries.

Each partner Pokémon also changes the background music and border color when playing puzzles.</p><p>The player starts with <a href=# title="Pikachu (Pokémon)">Pikachu</a> as their partner Pokémon, and can obtain several others as they progress through the game.</p><p>However, partner Pokémon do not appear in 20×20 or 30×30 puzzles - a zoom-out of the puzzle appears in their place - and the puzzle border will automatically change color depending on the current 10×10 quadrant selected: blue (top-left), yellow (top-right), red (bottom-left), or green (bottom-right). Despite this, the partner's background music will still be played.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Saving>Saving</span></h2><p>Two save files are available. The game will automatically save to the currently-played file at the following times:</p><ul><li>After successfully completing a puzzle.</li><li>Upon going to the main menu screen.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, a quick-save can be manually created from the pause menu while attempting a puzzle. Continuing from this quick-save will preserve the state of the puzzle grid - however, the quick-save will be deleted upon being loaded.</p><p>The screen shown after creating a quick-save shows <a href=# title="Nurse Joy">Nurse Joy</a> - this is her only appearance in the entire game.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Memories>Memories</span></h2><p>The game includes three possible animations played alongside the credits, called "memories". Each memory will automatically play once its conditions are met. Unlocked memories can be viewed again at any time from the main menu.</p><ul><li>Normal: Solve 8 puzzles in area 10 of "Pokémon Picross" mode.</li><li>Master: Solve all 151 Pokédex-eligible puzzles in "Pokémon Picross" mode.</li><li>Safari: Solve all puzzles in "Safari Picross" mode.</li></ul><p>If the Master memory is unlocked before the Safari memory, then at the end of the animation Misty will instruct the player to solve all Safari puzzles. If the Safari memory is unlocked first instead, Misty will tell the player to complete the Pokédex.</p><p>If both the Master and Safari memories have been unlocked, then Misty's dialogue in both memories is replaced with an acknowledgement that the player is a Pokémon Picross Master. If the memories are re-viewed from the main menu, this text will be retroactively applied to both.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Compatibility>Compatibility</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/9/9e/Picross_GBC_SGB.png decoding=async width=256 height=224 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Super Game Boy border.<p>The game was intended to work with the <a href=# title="Game Boy Printer">Game Boy Printer</a>.
