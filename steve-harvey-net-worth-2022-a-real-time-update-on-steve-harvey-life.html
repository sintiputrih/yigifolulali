He went to Kent State University and then <a href=# rel=noopener>West Virginia University</a>, where he earned his degree.

He made his comedy debut on October 8, 1985, at the Hilarities Comedy Club in Cleveland, Ohio, when he performed for the first time. The singer-songwriter is no stranger to adversity; during his early career, he was homeless for three years in the late 1980s, during which time he slept in his 1976 Ford pickup truck when the gigs he performed at didn’t provide a motel.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv)</a></p><p>When Harvey placed third in the Second Annual J<a href=# rel=noopener>ohnnie Walker National Comedy</a> Search in 1990, he was offered the role of host of the syndicated television show “Its Showtime at the Apollo.” He continued to perform stand-up comedy, appearing with Cedric the Entertainer, D.L. Hughley, and Bernie Mac on the 1997 Kings of Comedy tour in the United Kingdom. As one of the highest-earning comedy tours of all time, this tour grossed a combined total of $37 million in 1997 and 1998. Because of his success and recognition as a comedian, he has been offered roles in television shows such as “Me and the Boys” (1994), “The Steve Harvey Show” (1996-2002), “The Steve Harvey Morning Show,” a weekday radio program he has hosted since 2000, and films such as “The Fighting Temptations” (2003) and “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” (2005). (2003). Steven Harvey’s stand-up special “Steven Harvey: Don’t Trip… ” was released in 2006. I’m not sure he’s finished with me yet.”</p><h2><strong>Steve Harvey </strong><strong>Family Feud and Hosting</strong></h2><p>Harvey’s stand-up comedy career came to an end on August 2, 2012, when he performed his farewell act at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, capping out a 27-year run as a stand-up comedian. Harvey, on the other hand, has achieved considerable success in a variety of other enterprises in addition to his comic career.</p><p>Harvey is well-known as a dynamic and engaging host, perhaps even more so than he is as a stand-up comic. Harvey took over as host of the game program “Family Feud” in the year 2010. Moreover, he has served as host for the show for the longest straight period of time of any previous host. Harvey also serves as the host of a spin-off show, “Celebrity Family Feud.” He has gained contemporary celebrity as a result of the numerous viral videos depicting his reactions to “Family Feud” contestants who provide rude or erroneous answers. In 2013, he was nominated for the Outstanding Talk Show Host and Outstanding Game Show Host Daytime Emmy Awards, making him the first host to be nominated for both awards in the same year. During the same year, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv)</a></p><p>Harvey was the host of the Miss Universe 2015 pageant, which took place in Las Vegas in 2015. Despite his error, in which he wrongly declared the first-runner-up as the winner and had to admit a few minutes after she was crowned that he had read the results incorrectly, he has gone on to host the Miss Universe pageant in 2016, 2017, and 2018 despite the controversy surrounding it.</p><h2><strong>Steve Harvey Personal life</strong></h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Steve Harvey (@iamsteveharveytv)</a></p><p><strong>Harvey has been married three times throughout his life.</strong> His current wife, Marjorie Bridges, whom he married in 2007, is the mother of his children. Marjorie’s children, whom he adopted when the couple married, give him a total of seven children: three from his first marriage, one from his second marriage, and Marjorie’s three children from her first marriage. As a result of his partnership with Marjorie, he established The Steve and Marjorie Harvey Foundation, which is dedicated to youth outreach and education.</p><h2><strong>Steve Harvey House & Properties</strong></h2><p>In February 2018, Steve and Marjorie leased a large mansion in Beverly Park, a gated community atop Beverly Hills, California. The 12,000-square-foot house on just under 2 acres was once listed for lease at $125,000 PER MONTH, but the Harveys were able to talk the owners down to $110,000 per month. That works out to about $1.3 million in rent per year. The house was listed for sale for $23.5 million at one point in 2007.</p><p>Outside of Los Angeles, Steve Harvey owns a 9,000-square-foot mansion in Atlanta that he purchased in 2010 for $3.4 million, as well as a 4-acre mansion outside of Dallas, Texas. Steve bought a 5,500-square-foot house on the 88th floor of Trump International in Chicago in 2013. In 2018, he sold that property for $7.7 million.</p><p></p><p>In May 2020, Steve paid $15 million for Tyler Perry’s former Atlanta mansion. The 35,000-square-foot gated estate sits on 17 acres. Tyler purchased the house in 2017, spent millions on renovations, and sold it to an evangelist named David Turner for $17.5 million in 2016. Turner lost $2.5 million on the property.</p><h2 id=summary><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p><strong>Steve Harvey has an estimated net worth of $200 million.</strong> Among his many media empires are radio, television, apparel, novels, and other forms of entertainment. A normal year for him brings in $45 million from his multiple professions, including $10 million from hosting Family Feud, which he does for a living.</p><h2>Fans of “Family Feud” are left speechless by Steve Harvey’s wife Majorie sexy backless outfit.</h2><p>The other members of Steve Harvey’s marriage also have excellent fashion sense.</p><p>Marjorie, the wife of the Family Feud presenter, is always dressed to the nines, as was evident when the couple stepped out together last month while on vacation in Paris. Marjorie rocked the show in some of her most recognizable outfits, including a daring blazer dress, a white scarf top ensemble, and a timeless little black dress. But she also wore an all-black attire, which may have slipped Family Feud fans’ notice.</p><p>Marjorie shared a series of images on Instagram on July 5 in which she was seen sporting what appeared to be leather trousers and a halter top. The top was backless and featured a keyhole pattern with gold hardware accents.</p><p>Marjorie noted in the photographs that she finished the appearance with a black clutch purse and stiletto shoes. She also wore her hair in a straight ponytail and accessorized with understated gold. Steve didn’t take long to express his opinion to her after seeing her amazing dress. He left a “❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️” remark on his wife’s Instagram post.</p><p>Family Feud followers also stopped by Marjorie’s Instagram comments section without missing a beat. Unbelievable, a commenter wrote. “🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 You look fantastic,” a second person chimed in. “Mrs. Harvey, you are incredibly gorgeous! Just stunning! “,” a different supporter chimed in.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Marjorie Harvey (@marjorie_harvey)</a></p><p>The costume isn’t seen in any Instagram or TikTok videos, but Marjorie undoubtedly shone on the Parisian streets. Steve has previously discussed how she altered his sense of style. He said to E! News in an interview that Marjorie engaged his stylist Elly Karamoh to upgrade his wardrobe.</p><p>“Steve, look, you’ve been on TV, you have a brand, and you’ve safeguarded it for so long,” she continued. People never see how you dress when you’re not on TV,” “He told the publication. “I want you to begin dressing as you do offstage, but I’m going to get you some help because you don’t have time to go shopping.”</p><p>Steve finally thought that the solution was simple. What was I going to say to her if I said “No”?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6jBpsLEZp%2Baqqaaxm66xK1ksKeiqbVufo9raWaZXaeyoriMraCmnV2qvaWt055kqKZdqMGmwsRmn5qqpprGbrjIn5xoa2NqhnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsteve-harvey-net-worth-2022-a-real-time-update-on-steve-harvey-life.html&text=Steve%20Harvey%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Steve%20Harvey%20Life%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsteve-harvey-net-worth-2022-a-real-time-update-on-steve-harvey-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsteve-harvey-net-worth-2022-a-real-time-update-on-steve-harvey-life.html&title=Steve%20Harvey%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Steve%20Harvey%20Life%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsteve-harvey-net-worth-2022-a-real-time-update-on-steve-harvey-life.html&title=Steve%20Harvey%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Steve%20Harvey%20Life%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsteve-harvey-net-worth-2022-a-real-time-update-on-steve-harvey-life.html&title=Steve%20Harvey%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Steve%20Harvey%20Life%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsteve-harvey-net-worth-2022-a-real-time-update-on-steve-harvey-life.html&description=Steve%20Harvey%20Net%20Worth%202022%3a%20A%20Real%20Time%20Update%20On%20Steve%20Harvey%20Life%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-12-best-short-christmas-movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 12 best short Christmas movies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./shirley-ann-jackson-net-worth-income-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shirley Ann Jackson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
