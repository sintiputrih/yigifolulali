Since reaching adulthood in 2012, Hussein has actively fulfilled regent duties on several occasions and has accompanied his father on numerous local and international visits.</p><p>He is also reportedly actively involved in the Crown Prince Foundation, and this foundation greatly oversees a technical university as well as various scientific and humanitarian activities. Notably, at the age of 20, Hussein made history by becoming the youngest person to chair a UN Security Council session in 2015. It is also on record, after his graduation from Sandhurst in the year 2017, he reportedly made a notable global debut with his address at the UN General Assembly later that year.</p><p>Hussein’s journey to becoming the Crown Prince of Jordan had some unexpected turns. Despite being King Hussein’s eldest son, he was not initially expected to succeed to the throne. King Hussein had originally designated his younger brother, Prince Hassan, as the heir in 1965.</p><p>However, shortly before his death in 1999, the King changed his decision and named Abdullah as his successor. When Abdullah ascended to the throne, he appointed his half-brother, Prince Hamzah, as the heir designate. However, in 2004, King Abdullah removed Hamzah from the position of crown prince.</p><p>According to the Jordanian Constitution, the monarch’s eldest son automatically becomes first in line to the throne, unless stated otherwise. Thus, when Hamzah lost his status, Hussein became the heir apparent, and it was widely expected that the formal title of crown prince would be bestowed upon him. On 2 July 2009, a royal decree was issued officially conferring him the title.</p><p>While the Crown Prince’s role is predominantly ceremonial according to the constitution, Hussein has embraced various responsibilities. He has fulfilled official and military missions on behalf of his father and has acted as regent during the King’s absences from the country. Additionally, he is actively involved in the Crown Prince Foundation, which oversees a technical university and various scientific and humanitarian initiatives.</p><p>The foundation has initiated programs like Haqiq to promote youth volunteerism, a NASA internship program, MASAR to encourage space technology innovation, and the Hearing Without Borders initiative, which supports cochlear implants for Jordanians with hearing impairments. Under the NASA program, interns built Jordan’s first satellite named JY1, paying tribute to the late King Hussein’s amateur radio callsign.</p><p>Hussein’s commitment to service and leadership extends beyond Jordan’s borders. He underwent training with the Jordanian special forces elite 71st Counter Terrorism Battalion in 2013 and visited the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman in 2014 to meet injured Palestinians seeking medical treatment after fleeing Gaza.</p><p>In 2015, at the age of 20, he achieved a significant milestone by chairing a UN Security Council session focused on preventing youth from joining extremist groups. His efforts were widely praised, with then-Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon describing him as a leader of the 21st century. During the session, the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2250 on the maintenance of international peace and security, which was initiated by Jordan.</p><p>Hussein’s prominence continued to grow as he delivered the welcoming speech at the World Economic Forum in 2017 and represented Jordan at the UN General Assembly that same year. Observers have speculated that he will play an increasingly significant role both within Jordan and on the international stage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Crown Prince of Jordan Age</h2><p>As of 2022, he was 28 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Crown Prince of Jordan Parents</h2><p>His parents are Abdullah II of Jordan and Rania Al Abdullah.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Crown Prince of Jordan Wife</h2><p>He is married to Rajwa Al Saif.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Crown Prince of Jordan Children</h2><p>Details about his children are not known.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Crown Prince of Jordan Net Worth</h2><p>His estimated net worth is not less than $5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpypqK%2BeYr2ztc2cnGanlmK3sL7DmqVmmpmkerGt0Z6lratdrLansYycn6KklKeyr3s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcrown-prince-of-jordan-bio-parents-wife-children.html&text=Hussein%2c%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Jordan%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcrown-prince-of-jordan-bio-parents-wife-children.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcrown-prince-of-jordan-bio-parents-wife-children.html&title=Hussein%2c%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Jordan%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcrown-prince-of-jordan-bio-parents-wife-children.html&title=Hussein%2c%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Jordan%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcrown-prince-of-jordan-bio-parents-wife-children.html&title=Hussein%2c%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Jordan%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcrown-prince-of-jordan-bio-parents-wife-children.html&description=Hussein%2c%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Jordan%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Parents%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./peaky-blinders-season-4-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peaky Blinders Season 4 Review">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zendaya-oversized-button-up-as-minidress-date-with-tom-holland.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zendaya Wore Oversized Button-Up as Minidress on Date with Tom Holland">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
