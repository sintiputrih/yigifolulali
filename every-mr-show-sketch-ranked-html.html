If that strikes you as tragic, just watch the whole series — even at its low points, <i>Mr. Show</i> is still some of the funniest comedy around.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-8eab2808730585e1f08e33513f9a3940-3-0-0@published data-word-count=68><b>157. “Rap the Musical” (Season 2, Episode 2)<br>“</b>The fun of rap, without all that rap!” The <i>idea</i> of this sketch — what if rap was sanitized and reduced to stereotypical signifiers? — is decent enough, but something just feels off about the execution.
