She wrote about the fear that she felt during this time and said, "I’ve spent a lot of time lately thinking about the kid who woke up in that hospital bed, terrified she would never run a lap around a track or read a book again.

A few years ago, she was interviewed by TMZ Sports and was asked about her modeling goals.</p><p>Edens said, "I would love to walk for Chanel. I think Coco Chanel was one of the worst, just so bada** female entrepreneurs. She built an incredible empire for herself. I finished the French curriculum at my high school really early."

Since she is famous for being the daughter of the co-owner of the Bucks, Mallory Edens has been a public figure for a while now. However, she seems comfortable with her place in the spotlight. Whenever she gave interviews in the past, she was warm and polite. It seems like if she wants to comment on her romance with Aaron Rodgers, she will. Perhaps she is waiting for the right moment... or maybe she will decide that she doesn't want to say anything at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYmqqfo3qzu8OgnKurXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiuqK4y6ipsmWVmbKvv4ysoKWdnql6oq7Orqtmm5%2BjwbO71Z6prKGRoXqzsc%2Buq5qsmaS7cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faaron-rodgers-girlfriend-mallory-edens-silent-about-controversial-reputation.html&text=Has%20Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Girlfriend%20Mallory%20Edens%20Been%20Silent%20About%20His%20Controversial%20Reputation%3f%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faaron-rodgers-girlfriend-mallory-edens-silent-about-controversial-reputation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faaron-rodgers-girlfriend-mallory-edens-silent-about-controversial-reputation.html&title=Has%20Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Girlfriend%20Mallory%20Edens%20Been%20Silent%20About%20His%20Controversial%20Reputation%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faaron-rodgers-girlfriend-mallory-edens-silent-about-controversial-reputation.html&title=Has%20Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Girlfriend%20Mallory%20Edens%20Been%20Silent%20About%20His%20Controversial%20Reputation%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faaron-rodgers-girlfriend-mallory-edens-silent-about-controversial-reputation.html&title=Has%20Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Girlfriend%20Mallory%20Edens%20Been%20Silent%20About%20His%20Controversial%20Reputation%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faaron-rodgers-girlfriend-mallory-edens-silent-about-controversial-reputation.html&description=Has%20Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Girlfriend%20Mallory%20Edens%20Been%20Silent%20About%20His%20Controversial%20Reputation%3f%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tickle-moonshiners-wiki-wife-net-worth-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tickle Moonshiners- Wiki, Wife, Net Worth, Height">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./better-than-good-live.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Better Than Good - Live">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
