href=#>Triple H</a>, real name Paul Michael Levesque, has a staggering net worth of $250million.</p><p>This is thanks to his long and successful career not only as a wrestler but also as an actor.</p><p>Also known as <a href=#>Hunter Hearst Helmsley (Triple H</a>), the 54-year-old has served as the Executive Vice President of Talent, Live Events, and Creative at WWE since 2013.</p><p>He is also the founder of NXT, an offshoot WWE brand.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON WWE">READ MORE ON WWE</h2><p>In 2013, Levesque earned a reported combined salary of just over $1.5million from his front office job and as a wrestler.</p><p>More recently Triple H's WWE annual salary was $2.8 million.</p><p>The legendary wrestler also owns several million worth of WWE stock.</p><p>Levesque made his <a href=#>wrestling</a> debut in 1992 and has been climbing the ladder of success ever since.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in

class=suggested-link>television</span> after an&nbsp;"I Quit" match&nbsp;with her father.</p><p>On January 10, 2023, McMahon announced her resignation from WWE upon her father's return as chairman of the company after he retired in 2022.</p><p>McMahon has appeared on promotional posters for WWE events such as the&nbsp;Royal Rumble&nbsp;of 2006 and the&nbsp;Elimination Chamber&nbsp;of
