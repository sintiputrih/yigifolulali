In the case of Jeremy Meeks, the prison was perhaps the best thing that happened to him. While others struggle to get their lives in order after prison, Jeremy had a lucrative modeling contract waiting for him as soon as he left prison.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jeremy Meeks Wiki</strong></h2><p>Jeremy Meeks is an American fashion model who was born on February 7, 1984. He became popular after he was tagged Operation Ceasefire after his arrest during a gang search in Stockton, California in 2014. As usual, the cops took a mug shot of him, but the picture found its way into social media and spread virally. Jeremy’s good looks made all the right tongues wag.</p><p>He was arrested for a major crime of street terrorism as well as for an offense of resistance/obstruction of justice. He was imprisoned at the Mendota Federal Correctional Institution but was released in March 2016, which prompted him to start his career as a model.</p><p>During his 27-month prison sentence, Meeks was soon branded a “hot criminal” in the media and signed a modeling contract with White Cross Management. During his time behind bars, he was picked up by talent agent Gina Rodriguez. In February 2017, he made an appearance during New York Fashion Week, which subsequently became his catwalk debut. He made an unprecedented appearance for Vogue magazine, which earned him the unsurprising nickname “buff bad boy”.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Life, Death and Career Achievements of Caleb Logan – The Bratayley YouTuber</a></strong></p><p>In June 2017, he was invited to Milan Fashion Week, which led to him being one of the models on the Milan catwalk as an employee of world-famous German fashion designer Phillip Plein.</p><p>After his heroic deeds in Milan in February 2017, he appeared in August 2017 in a campaign for the Israeli sunglasses fashion house “Carolina Lemke”, partly owned by Bar Refaeli, a well-known name in Israeli fashion. The campaign focused on the background of Meeks, Rafaeli appeared in the campaign side by side with Meeks. Supermodel Raphaeli showered Meeks with much deserved praise and applause, saying: “There has never been such a mix before”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jeremy Meeks Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Jeremy Meeks, nicknamed the “hot criminal”, bases his modeling style on his typical American bad-boy look. The Blue Bandit, as he is known, is one of the highest-paid men at Instagram, earning over $30,000-$50,000 per Instagram post and demanding $15,000-$30,000 per month and $180,000-$360,000 per year from modeling brands. He drives a black Maserati that costs about $135,000, which brings his earnings and income to about $1 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Family, Wife & Kids</strong></h2><p>Jeremy Meeks met Melissa, the mother of his son, in 2007 and they met for about a year and got married in 2008 and their marriage was blessed with a son – Jeremy Meeks Jr. Jeremy Meeks has another son from a previous relationship called Robert. Their 9-year marriage ended later when pictures of the model who kissed Chloe Green appeared.</p><p>The photo shows the couple enjoying themselves on a yacht. In early 2018, pictures appeared showing the duo hugging each other in a pool. Melissa found out and filed for divorce. She said she felt “humiliated” because Jeremy claimed to be on a work trip to Turkey.</p><p>She was quoted as saying, “We talked about the divorce. I told him I didn’t think the marriage could be saved. He agreed. The marriage is over.”</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Milana Vayntrub Wiki, Height, Body Measurements, Feet, Net Worth</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Jeremy Meeks Brothers, Parents</strong></h2><p>Meeks has two brothers Emery Meeks and Bryan Varela and a sister named Leanna Rominger who is 12 years older than him and took custody of little Jeremy over 20 years ago when he was 10 years old. Their mother had been in and out of prison throughout her childhood and was unable to care for her children. So Leanna did a pretty good job as a sister who became a mother. Thank God she saved the handsome man so that the world can enjoy his good looks today.</p><p>Jeremy’s mother Katherine Angier, born in June 1954, is known as the mother who set up a fan site and solicited funds for her son’s trial.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kt6a%2BxKawZqWVmri0edainZ5lkqe8tbTEq2SpmaKau7W%2FjJ%2BYpqGcrnq4tcqiZKedpGLEsL7ToWSkoZSofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeremy-meeks-wife-brother-parents-family-wiki-net-worth-kids.html&text=Jeremy%20Meeks%20Wife%2c%20Brother%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeremy-meeks-wife-brother-parents-family-wiki-net-worth-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeremy-meeks-wife-brother-parents-family-wiki-net-worth-kids.html&title=Jeremy%20Meeks%20Wife%2c%20Brother%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeremy-meeks-wife-brother-parents-family-wiki-net-worth-kids.html&title=Jeremy%20Meeks%20Wife%2c%20Brother%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeremy-meeks-wife-brother-parents-family-wiki-net-worth-kids.html&title=Jeremy%20Meeks%20Wife%2c%20Brother%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeremy-meeks-wife-brother-parents-family-wiki-net-worth-kids.html&description=Jeremy%20Meeks%20Wife%2c%20Brother%2c%20Parents%2c%20Family%2c%20Wiki%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sony-5g-mmwave-xperia-smartphone-prototype.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sony Has a Prototype 5G mmWave Xperia Smartphone">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./heres-leonardo-dicaprio-couldve-looked-james-camerons-spiderman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heres How Leonardo DiCaprio Couldve Looked In James Camerons Spider-Man">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
