When Steve Martin and Martin Short were asked by the host Ali Plumb what was their Selena Gomez song, Martin said that it was the ‘splish, splash, I was taking a bath’ song which was the song Gomez sang during her formative Barney years. Short on the hand answered that she loved Gomez’s cover of W-A-P to which Selena said that it’s WAP and not W-A-P.

The veteran American actor who had won five Grammy Awards stated that the American singer, actress, and producer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez is just fantastic</a>, and he had a great time filming with her.

Selena Gomez seemed to have always formed a bond with her co-stars and a lot of the actors she has worked with can only say good things about her.
