He captioned the image:</p><p>“Hang the jersey from the rafters. The kid is out the game. I was so nervous I actually said ‘Will you spend the LEST of your RIFE with me.’ Here’s to the lest of our rives my love.”</p><p>Throughout their <strong>relationship</strong>, Andrew has always been private about who his girlfriend is. Therefore, the only hint we’ve had is a now-deleted Reddit post from someone claiming to have found her. His partner’s name is Emma Turner and her Instagram handle is ‘@emma.k.turner’. Andrew’s fiancée in fact commented on the engagement pic calling him her “monkey for life”.</p><p>Although he’s always been elusive with details of his partner, he regularly talks about her during his podcast Flagrant 2, including stories about her catching coronavirus and moving in together. Moreover, his relationship with his fiancée might be private but comedian Andrew openly dated singer Sara Phillips. However they broke up in 2015 and he said on The Brilliant Idiots podcast that they grew apart, which left them with no chemistry.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-82738 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Andrew-Schulz-gf.jpg alt="Andrew Schulz" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-82738 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Andrew Schulz and his fiancée making videos with their pet dogs.
