Wiki Bio</span></h2><p>Matt Ox was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA, on 13 December 2004, so under the zodiac sign of Sagittarius and holding American nationality – he is popular for his still youthful career of a rapper, while he is also a YouTuber.</p><h2><span id=Childhood_and_education>Childhood and education</span></h2><p>Matt has spent his entire childhood in the Lawncrest neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia. He prefers not to talk about the early years of his life, as his father committed suicide while Matt was still just a kid – his mother’s name is Laurel but her profession is not known. Matt appears to be an only child, as he hasn’t mentioned having any siblings.</p><p>Matt grew up listening to Eminem, Kendrick Lamar and Marilyn Manson, and promised to himself that he was going to become a popular rapper one day. His uncle often went to a music studio and took Matt with him, which led Matt to start writing his own rap songs when he was around eight years old. By the time he was 11, Matt had already published his first song.</p><p>He is currently attending second grade of high school and is not planning on enrolling at college, but will rather focus on a career of a rapper.</p><h2><span id=Career_of_a_rapper>Career of a rapper</span></h2><p>The first song for which Matt became popular is “Pretty Penny”, released in January 2017. His name was soon easily recognizable on the internet, and he has already collaborated with many rappers, including Swami Mags, Chxpo, and Lil Tracy. He became popular after working with the “Working on Dying” rap group, and is currently managed by Rich F1lthy Ortiz and Terrell Finesse Green. Even though he is still very young, Matt has nevertheless managed to work with some of the most popular rap producers, such as OogieMane and Froza – his “Low Key” song was launched in February 2017 and he released “Michael Myers” and “This N That” after that. Matt is mostly popular thanks to his song “Overwhelming”, as it was listened to more than 10,000 times in the first day of its upload on SoundCloud, and the <a rel=nofollow href=#>song’s video on YouTube</a> has so far been viewed more than 27 million times – it attracted “The New York Times” and “XXL” magazines’ writers, who later wrote about the young rapper.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/matt-ox-1.jpg></p><p>The song helped him sign a contract with Warner Bros. Records in September 2017. In 2018, Matt released several songs including “Tesla” and “Hop Scotch”, and his first full album came out in October 2018, entitled “OX” and featuring several other rappers, including Key! and Valee. Matt is a YouTuber as well – he launched <a rel=nofollow href=#>his channel</a> on 16 August 2017, and there are currently more than 170,000 people subscribed to it, while it also counts over 15.5 million views of all his videos combined. Matt is mostly focused on uploading his music videos.</p><h2><span id=The_most_popular_rappers_in_the_world>The most popular rappers in the world</span></h2><p>The Ranker website has compiled the list of the most popular male rappers in the world judging by people’s votes. While the list is pretty much subjectively created on regards of what people enjoy to listen to, many agree that the people in it have indeed become the best and the most famous rappers in the entire world. We are going to mention five of them:</p><ul><li>Fifth place is held by <a rel=nofollow href=#>50 Cent</a> whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III and who is also a songwriter, actor, TV producer, entrepreneur, and investor. He came to prominence after being discovered by Eminem and after signing with Shady Records;</li><li><a rel=nofollow href=#>Dre</a> – whose real name is Andre Romelle Young – is in fourth place, and is a record producer and an entrepreneur as well, currently the third richest person in the hip hop industry, as his net worth has been estimated to be more than $770 million;</li><li>In third place is <a rel=nofollow href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> (Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.) – he was discovered by Dr. Dre and was featured in his first album “Deep Cover”. Since the launch of his career, Snoop Dogg has sold more than 23 million albums just in the US, and has been given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame;</li><li>Second place goes to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kendrick Lamar</a> who is considered to be the best rapper of his generation – he launched his career while he was still a teen and became popular after the release of his major label debut album entitled “Good Kid, M.A.A.D City” which was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (IRAA);</li><li>Top place goes to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Eminem (Marshall Bruce Mathers III)</a>, who is also a record producer, record executive, film producer, and an actor. He has been given the title of King of Hip Hop, and is also popular from starring in the “8 Mile” movie, which follows his early life.</li></ul><p>Although Matt is a very skillful rapper, he is nowhere to be found in the list of the most popular rappers in the world compiled by the Ranker website.</p><h2><span id=Matts_personal_life_and_relationships>Matt’s personal life and relationships</span></h2><p>Matt is very secretive when it comes to his love life, as he hasn’t shared much about his past and present relationships with the public. Matt is still only 14 years old, however, he was rumored to be going out with a girl he met in 2018 during one of his performances in a local pub – the two sat for a drink (tea) after his performance and fell for one another. They had allegedly dated for three months before calling it quits, due to jealousy issues.</p><p>Many of his fans have stated to have seen Matt walking in the streets holding hands with a mysterious girl – while most people believe that Matt is currently dating the mysterious girl, he hasn’t commented on the matter – of course at his age he is unmarried.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_other_interests>Hobbies and other interests</span></h2><p>Matt might seem to be only focused on his career as a rapper and a YouTuber, but he has numerous other interests, too.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>ROLLING LOUD! <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/57xzxfD77v</a></p><p>— ㄖ乂 (@mattox__) <a rel=nofollow href=#>May 14, 2019</a></p><p>His main hobby is cosplay, which is the art of dressing as one’s favorite anime characters, game characters, superheroes, and others – he has been to many of the cosplay events organized in his vicinity. This has also made him fall in love with travelling all around the US, to attend the cosplay events organized in other cities and states.</p><p>Matt is very fond of animes, and some of his favorites are “Death Note” and “Naruto” – he also enjoys watching animated movies made by the popular Studio Ghibli, and some of his favorites include “Ponyo” and “Porco Rosso”. Matt is said to be a big lover of animals, and has a pet dog and a cat, however, due to his obligations, he doesn’t have much free time to spend with them.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_and_net_worth>Appearance and net worth</span></h2><p>Matt is currently 14 years old. He has medium long brown hair and brown eyes, and is 5ft 2in (1.58m) tall, while his weight is not known.</p><p>According to authoritative sources, his current net worth is estimated to be more than $400,000, and is steadily rising thanks to his career of a rapper.</p><h2><span id=Social_media_presence>Social media presence</span></h2><p>Matt is very active on several popular social media networks, as this is very important for his career on the internet.</p><p>He launched his Twitter account in June 2017, and has gathered nearly 30,000 followers and tweeted more than 1,500 times.
