He has been absent due to a neck injury that he suffered during a match against the Brawling Brutes.</p><p>During his absence, while he was rehabbing, the Muscle of The New Day was also working on a special project called Bridges under the name ‘Our Heroes Rock.’ He recently opened up about what the future of the series looks like.</p><p>Our Heroes Rock’s Bridges is streaming on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>. It is a project that aims to enlighten the younger generation about Black History and its heroes. Big E created the project with Andreas Hale and Jonathan Davenport.</p><p>Recently, the WWE Grandslam Champion was interviewed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah O’Connell</a> on her show. During the interview, Big E discussed more about the series and gave some insight into the future episodes.</p><p>“That is the dream. That is really the goal is to just tell more of these stories. Right now we have a pitch deck that I love. Johnny [Narrative Designer] already has three seasons mapped out. My agent has it and is now working on shopping it. So really for us, I… We could really do another Kickstarter. But really right now, our goal is to take the short film, take our pitch deck and all of our assets and shop it around. And we would love… The dream is to have a series, to have a major streamer behind us, helping us find, because like I said, it is very expensive.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-big-e-didn-t-want-to-short-change-people>Big E didn’t want to short-change people</h2><p>The Bridges <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter</a> generated more than $130,000 during its campaign. However, this was still short of the amount needed to finance the project they way they envisioned it. Big E said he put up the rest of the money they needed, highlighting how important delivering a high-quality product was to them.</p><p>“This endeavor is expensive for this quality of animation. We want it to look good. Because one of the things we talk about is too often, when we were kids, ‘Black projects’ often felt like they didn’t have the same budget and we didn’t want to short-change people. We didn’t want to have a lower grade of animation just to make sure this happened. We wanted to give the people the very best for this thing. So that is our goal. And that is really why we have been pounding the pavement and asking people to watch,” Big E said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ2mmru1e9awnGhpZGl%2FeIOUZpmin12aeritza2qZqyfYsCpu89mpq6qXZ2ys7vErGSrp5OgerW7jJpkppmapL9uv9OrnJqllad6tK3YrGStoJWueqmt1Z5kraCimrJuv8Saqqimo2K6orzPnptmp6Wp</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f1442775-big-e-wants-to-shop-our-heroes-rock-to-a-major-streamer-says-they-have-three-seasons-mapped-out.html&text=Big%20E%20Wants%20To%20Shop%20Our%20Heroes%20Rock%20To%20A%20Major%20Streamer%2c%20Says%20They%20Have%20Three%20Seasons%20Mapped%20O&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1442775-big-e-wants-to-shop-our-heroes-rock-to-a-major-streamer-says-they-have-three-seasons-mapped-out.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1442775-big-e-wants-to-shop-our-heroes-rock-to-a-major-streamer-says-they-have-three-seasons-mapped-out.html&title=Big%20E%20Wants%20To%20Shop%20Our%20Heroes%20Rock%20To%20A%20Major%20Streamer%2c%20Says%20They%20Have%20Three%20Seasons%20Mapped%20O" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f1442775-big-e-wants-to-shop-our-heroes-rock-to-a-major-streamer-says-they-have-three-seasons-mapped-out.html&title=Big%20E%20Wants%20To%20Shop%20Our%20Heroes%20Rock%20To%20A%20Major%20Streamer%2c%20Says%20They%20Have%20Three%20Seasons%20Mapped%20O" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f1442775-big-e-wants-to-shop-our-heroes-rock-to-a-major-streamer-says-they-have-three-seasons-mapped-out.html&title=Big%20E%20Wants%20To%20Shop%20Our%20Heroes%20Rock%20To%20A%20Major%20Streamer%2c%20Says%20They%20Have%20Three%20Seasons%20Mapped%20O" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1442775-big-e-wants-to-shop-our-heroes-rock-to-a-major-streamer-says-they-have-three-seasons-mapped-out.html&description=Big%20E%20Wants%20To%20Shop%20Our%20Heroes%20Rock%20To%20A%20Major%20Streamer%2c%20Says%20They%20Have%20Three%20Seasons%20Mapped%20O" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./minimo-glow-face-scrub-review-sale-7555573.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="In Less Than 10 Minutes, This On-Sale Exfoliator Gives Me a Youthful Glow">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pool-party-essentials.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Essentials for the Perfect Pool Party">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
