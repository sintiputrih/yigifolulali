Sadly, in real life, things often aren’t that simple. After all, many families have a dynamic that is so toxic that they break off all communication for one reason or another. In fact, there have been many <a href=#>celebrities who’ve taken their own family members to court</a> since things were so messed up for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the outside looking in, it seems like <a href=#>Zac Efron’s</a> life is pretty much perfect. After all, Efron is rich, famous, beloved, and he was born with incredibly good looks. Of course, just because it seems like everything is going Efron’s way doesn’t mean that is the reality. For example, it is entirely possible that Efron has a rough relationship with the people in his family. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, is Zac Efron close with his brother and sister?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ariel Winter & Other Celebs Who Feuded With Their Own Parent</a></span></p><h2 id=a-surprise-sister>A Surprise Sister</h2><p>Ever since Zac Efron rose to fame during the mid-2000s, the talented actor has had an extremely devoted fan following, to say the very least. Since there were so many people who followed Zac Efron’s personal life and career closely, it isn’t surprising that many of them thought they knew everything about the guy. Then, in mid-2021, a then 33-year-old <a href=#>Efron shocked his fans by revealing that he has a baby sister</a> on social media.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Zac Efron shared a photo of himself with his little sister for the first time over Instagram, the image was accompanied by a sweet caption. “My sister Olivia, little heartbreaker.” Since Olivia is still a toddler, her relationship with her big brother Zac can’t be too complicated. That said, looking at the photo of Zac and Olivia together, it certainly seems like the siblings with a massive age gap have a loving relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Zac Efron's Secret Baby Sister, Olivia</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-efron-brothers>The Efron Brothers</h2><p>When most people are kids, they spend almost all of their time with their siblings, especially if they are in the same age range. However, when a lot of siblings grow up, they go their separate ways. With that in mind, it likely wouldn’t have shocked anyone if Zac and Dylan Efron weren’t that close now that they are both adults. Based on all of the publically available information, however, it seems like Zac and Dylan Efron are extremely close.</p><p>At the time of Dylan Efron’s 2019 birthday, his big brother Zac took to Instagram to wish his younger sibling a happy birthday. Instead of just posing an image of himself alongside his brother with the typical birthday well wishes, Zac made how much his little brother means to him very clear. "Happy birthday @dylanefron! Honestly, I never in my wildest dreams, would’ve thought that the little terror, devil, monster that was my little brother would turn into my very best friend. I’m so proud of the man you are today. Let’s save the world together - one waterfall at a time. Love ya little brother!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans React To Zac Efron Busting His Grandpa Out Of A Retirement Home</a></span></p><p>Of course, everyone knows that actions speak a lot louder than words. With that in mind, some people may wonder if Zac Efron’s birthday tribute to his little brother was much adieu about nothing. After all, a lot of people want it to seem like their life is perfect on social media even though everyone has their own problems. Fortunately for Zac and Dylan Efron, everything points to the idea that the brothers are extremely close. For example, when the travel show Down to Earth with Zac Efron went into production, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dylan worked as a producer on his big brother’s series</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though it says a lot that Zac Efron got his little brother Dylan a notable job on his TV show, that is far from the only indication that the siblings are close. After all, during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Zac revealed that he and Dylan live together. Considering that the brothers were both adults by that time, it was pretty surprising to learn that the siblings were cohabitating, especially since Zac is rich enough to afford a gorgeous place by himself. Of course, a lot of people may have assumed that the Efron brothers only lived together for a very small amount of time. As it turns out, however, that certainly wasn’t the case. After all, several months after he first talked about living with Dylan on a talk show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac revealed that he was still sharing a home with his brother</a> during another Jimmy Kimmel Live! appearance.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Things Few People Know About Zac Efron's Brother, Dylan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGixmptdmrOzu81mmaunpJ2ys3nDsqOapl2Wu6V50qKqrZ2iYryttdWimGaqlaGutbXOp6qhoaBis6Kv06xkaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzac-efron-brother-dylan-and-sister-olivia-relationship-facts.html&text=Is%20Zac%20Efron%20Actually%20Close%20With%20His%20Brother%20And%20Sister%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzac-efron-brother-dylan-and-sister-olivia-relationship-facts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzac-efron-brother-dylan-and-sister-olivia-relationship-facts.html&title=Is%20Zac%20Efron%20Actually%20Close%20With%20His%20Brother%20And%20Sister%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzac-efron-brother-dylan-and-sister-olivia-relationship-facts.html&title=Is%20Zac%20Efron%20Actually%20Close%20With%20His%20Brother%20And%20Sister%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzac-efron-brother-dylan-and-sister-olivia-relationship-facts.html&title=Is%20Zac%20Efron%20Actually%20Close%20With%20His%20Brother%20And%20Sister%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzac-efron-brother-dylan-and-sister-olivia-relationship-facts.html&description=Is%20Zac%20Efron%20Actually%20Close%20With%20His%20Brother%20And%20Sister%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./star-trek-strange-new-worlds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Strange New Worlds  TV Episode Recaps &amp;amp; News">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cobra-kai-season-five-trailer-release-date-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cobra Kai Season 5 Trailer: The Valley Is Still at War">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
