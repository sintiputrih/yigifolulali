She also portrayed the part of Anna-Kat Otto in the ABC sitcom American Housewife.</p><p>Butters began acting at the age of two by appearing in advertisements. Gabby was her first speaking character on Criminal Minds. She then played the role of Ella in the Transparent television series on Amazon Prime Video.</p><p>Julia received a role in the 2020 Netflix film The Gray Man. She received an offer to star in The Fabelmans movie, a semi-autobiographical work by Steven Spielberg, because of her exceptional acting abilities. The character she is portraying is based on Spielberg’s sister, Anna Fabelman.</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Julia-Butters-1-646x450.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-50672 alt="Julia Butters" width=646 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-50672 class=wp-caption-text>Julia Butters</p><p>Darrin Butters and Lorelei Butters welcomed Julia into the world in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>The actress’s father works in the movie business, which made it simple for her to begin her acting career at an early age. Her mother is a stay-at-home mom, while her father is a Disney animator who has contributed to movies including Frozen and Ralph Breaks the Internet.</p><p>In addition to CGI, Darrin has performed in a few drama series. He also frequently attends MLB games at Dodger Stadium because he is a huge LA Dodgers fan. The father of the actress is from Kearney, Nebraska.</p><p>Julia’s mother, Lorelei, is a loving homemaker who works tirelessly to advance Julia’s profession. Julia’s work is being actively cultivated and managed by her. She has also lent her voice to the Little Mermaid, an animated movie. Los Angeles, California is where Lorelei is from.</p><h2 id=how-old-is-the-young-actress-julia-buttersnbsp><span id=How_Old_Is_The_Young_Actress_Julia_Butters>How Old Is The Young Actress Julia Butters?</span></h2><p>Julia Butters was born on April 15, 2009, making her thirteen years old as of 2022.</p><p>This young actress was born to Darrin and Lorelie after five years of marriage. Additionally, since Julia is the only child the couple currently has, the little actress is the only one without a brother or sister.</p><p>Since she was two years old, Julia has been acting professionally. At the age of 13, she has been in six films and eight television programmes. Additionally, she received a 2019 award from the Las Vegas Film Critics Society for the movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</p><p>The Gray Man, a new Netflix film starring the 13-year-old, was made available on July 15, 2022. For her portrayal as Claire Fitzroy, she received high marks from both critics and viewers from all over the world.</p><p>At just 13 years old, Julia is already succeeding in the acting industry, having amassed a net worth of almost $400,000.</p><p>Moreover, according to ZipRecruiter, which determines the typical salary of an American actor, Darrin’s daughter earns about $100,815 annually from her acting talent.</p><p>She is well-liked by Hollywood moviegoers and directors due to her excellent acting abilities. Therefore, Butters’s net worth appears to be rising as he continues to delight his admirers with his distinctive acting abilities.</p><h2 id=her-father-darrin-butters-and-mother-lorelie-butters-age-difference><span id=Her_Father_Darrin_Butters_And_Mother_Lorelie_Butters_Age_Difference>Her Father Darrin Butters And Mother Lorelie Butters Age Difference</span></h2><p>According to their outward look, Darrin and Lorelie Butters appear to be between 35 and 45 years old.</p><p>Since Julia’s parents were married in 2004, which was 18 years ago, they must be in their mid-to-late 30s to mid-40s. Darrin’s face appears to be a little older than that of his wife, suggesting that he may be older than Lorelie.</p><p>The actress’s parents’ age isn’t specified, but based on their images, we may infer that there isn’t much of a gap in their ages. Additionally, the couple’s age gaps would only be two to three years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaeqi%2BwLJkppmeYrCiv9NmmJysoprAtHnJrqOimV2XwrXAxKuqrGWglr%2BmutOsZJqqlWKxor7RoqVmmqWpwaa%2B0maYp5xdobyzscuinGaapanBpr7SaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-gray-man-cast-actress-julia-butterss-parents-are-darrin-butters-and-lorelie-butters.html&text=The%20Gray%20Man%20Cast%20Actress%20Julia%20Butters%27s%20Parents%20Are%20Darrin%20Butters%20and%20Lorelie%20Butters&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-gray-man-cast-actress-julia-butterss-parents-are-darrin-butters-and-lorelie-butters.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-gray-man-cast-actress-julia-butterss-parents-are-darrin-butters-and-lorelie-butters.html&title=The%20Gray%20Man%20Cast%20Actress%20Julia%20Butters%27s%20Parents%20Are%20Darrin%20Butters%20and%20Lorelie%20Butters" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-gray-man-cast-actress-julia-butterss-parents-are-darrin-butters-and-lorelie-butters.html&title=The%20Gray%20Man%20Cast%20Actress%20Julia%20Butters%27s%20Parents%20Are%20Darrin%20Butters%20and%20Lorelie%20Butters" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-gray-man-cast-actress-julia-butterss-parents-are-darrin-butters-and-lorelie-butters.html&title=The%20Gray%20Man%20Cast%20Actress%20Julia%20Butters%27s%20Parents%20Are%20Darrin%20Butters%20and%20Lorelie%20Butters" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-gray-man-cast-actress-julia-butterss-parents-are-darrin-butters-and-lorelie-butters.html&description=The%20Gray%20Man%20Cast%20Actress%20Julia%20Butters%27s%20Parents%20Are%20Darrin%20Butters%20and%20Lorelie%20Butters" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-the-cast-of-willy-wonka-and-the-chocolate-factory.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What happened to the cast of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./esmeralda-gosling.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Esmeralda Amada Gosling Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
