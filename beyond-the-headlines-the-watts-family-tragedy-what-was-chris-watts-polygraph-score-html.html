Watts, who is currently serving five life sentences without the possibility of the parole for the murders, then hid their bodies in oil tanks and a makeshift grave at his worksite.</p><p id=par-3_39>A new Lifetime documentary about the murders, Beyond the Headlines: The Watts Family Tragedy, premiered on Jan. 25 just after the network’s “ripped from the headlines” fictionalized movie about the notorious crime, <a href=#>Chris Watts: Confessions of a Killer</a>.</p><p id=par-4_52>In the <a href=#>Lifetime documentary</a>, law enforcement officials who interrogated Watts revealed secrets about the brutal murders. Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) agent&nbsp;<a href=#>Tammy&nbsp;Lee</a>, who became close to the case and famously issued Watts’ polygraph test, shared what it was like to give Watts his lie detector test just days after Shan’ann went missing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ChrisWatts.jpg><h3>Lee said she acted ‘bubbly’ with Watts to get him to talk</h3><p id=par-5_53>Lee told Lifetime producers that she tried to build trust with Watts in order to give him a false sense of security before the polygraph. Before she issued the test, officials had already been tipped off about Watts’ affair with his co-worker <a href=#>Nichol Kessinger</a>, which mean they knew he was lying about something.</p><p id=par-6_29>“I conduct all my polygraphs the same,” Lee explained in Beyond the Headlines: The Watts Family Tragedy. “I’m very bubbly. I find it very easy to maintain rapport with someone.”</p><p id=par-7_51>In police footage, Lee leaned in to Watts and clearly tried to establish a sense of rapport through praise. “I think that’s totally awesome that you’re here today,” she told Watts. “I mean, I commend you. We do this in all of our missing person cases, so don’t think that we’re just singling you out.”</p><p id=par-8_36>Lee explained that this was all part of the game. “I needed Chris to know that I was his friend, I was there to listen, and I was there to hear his story,” the agent said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>The CBI agent delivered the polygraph test one-on-one with Watts</h2><p id=par-9_50>But just before she launched into the questions, Lee’s tone changed a bit. “Right now, there’s only one person in this room that knows what the truth is,” she told Watts as he was prepped for the test, “and in about five minutes, there’s gonna be two of us, so that’s the coolest part.”</p><p id=par-10_16>The CBI agent explained that this technique was meant to push the subject to be truthful.</p><p id=par-11_40>“We call it ‘snapping a knot in their a**,” she told <a href=#>Lifetime producers</a>. “That’s what we do right before the polygraph. Because we want them to know, it’s over. Whatever you’re saying…you better be truthful, because we’re gonna find out.”</p><p id=par-12_43>Lee then asked Watts a series of questions about Shan’ann’s disappearance: “Do you know where Shan’ann is now? Did you physically cause Shan’ann’s disappearance? Are you lying about the last time you saw Shan’ann?” Watts responded “no” to each and every one.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h3>There was little doubt of Watt’s guilt after the polygraph</h3><p id=par-13_16>Watts failed the polygraph with flying colors, Lee told Beyond the Headlines: The Watts Family Tragedy producers.</p><p id=par-14_41>As soon as he answered the questions, she knew something was very, very wrong. “The type of testing format that I used, we would consider someone to be deceptive if they were a negative 4 or below,” Lee explained. “Chris Watts scored negative 18.”</p><p id=par-15_46>With that virtually undeniable result, Lee’s focus switched to wrangling a confession out of the now-convicted killer. “Immediately, I started thinking about, how are we going to get him to confess to this?” the CBI agent said. “Because at that point, I knew he’d done it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvpsXOp5tmrJiaeqmxwJ2joqaVqHq1tMRmrpqspKh6p63MoqOyZaSnrqixw7JksKCRqXq4rdJmmqGqmah6uK3TrapmqJ%2Bhxqi%2BwKmfZquTpL%2BmesetpKVn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbeyond-the-headlines-the-watts-family-tragedy-what-was-chris-watts-polygraph-score-html.html&text=What%20Was%20Chris%20Watts%20Polygraph%20Score%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeyond-the-headlines-the-watts-family-tragedy-what-was-chris-watts-polygraph-score-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeyond-the-headlines-the-watts-family-tragedy-what-was-chris-watts-polygraph-score-html.html&title=What%20Was%20Chris%20Watts%20Polygraph%20Score%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbeyond-the-headlines-the-watts-family-tragedy-what-was-chris-watts-polygraph-score-html.html&title=What%20Was%20Chris%20Watts%20Polygraph%20Score%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbeyond-the-headlines-the-watts-family-tragedy-what-was-chris-watts-polygraph-score-html.html&title=What%20Was%20Chris%20Watts%20Polygraph%20Score%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeyond-the-headlines-the-watts-family-tragedy-what-was-chris-watts-polygraph-score-html.html&description=What%20Was%20Chris%20Watts%20Polygraph%20Score%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dua-lipa-puma-collection-london-launch-party.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dua Lipa Hosts a Mini Rave in East London to Celebrate New Puma Collection">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./madeleine-mccann-julia-wendells-familys-pain-after-dna-test-results.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Madeleine McCann: Julia Wendells familys pain after DNA test results">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
