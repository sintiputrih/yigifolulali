Things just fell into place, like the Devil was leading me,” <a href=#>Andre Bing</a> wrote before killing six of his coworkers in the break room at the beginning of their night shift on Tuesday.</p><p style=color:#252525><a href=#>Dahmer was a well-known loner who killed 17 young men</a>. He tried to turn some of them into sex zombies, and he ate body parts from others. In 1994, he was killed in prison.</p><p style=color:#252525>Chesapeake, Virginia, police released Bing’s redacted screed, which was found during a forensic analysis of the suspect’s phone after he killed people and then killed himself.</p><p style=color:#252525>Officials also said that loner Bing bought the murder weapon, a 9mm handgun, legally the morning of the rampage, even though he had never been in trouble with the law before.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Andre-Bing-77-2.jpg alt="Bing, 31, apologized to God for what he was about to do and whined about being mistreated by his colleagues.

He said, “I just wanted a wife who was as tied to thought as I was, but I didn’t deserve a wife.”</p><p style=color:#252525>Bing said that he wanted to help a coworker who seemed to have cancer.

He once said that he had “anger issues.” But he could also make people laugh, and it looked like he was dealing with the usual stresses of work that many people face.</p><p><strong>Related Stories Recommended By Writer:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Walmart Shooting Update: Six ‘targeted’ Including Teenager By Suspect Andre Bing In Chesapeake Rampage</a></li><li><a href=#>Shooting At US Walmart Store 7 people dead, including gunman</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfqb%2BmusOipaBnp5a5rq3RrWSgrZ6irq95wKebq51dl7avs9JmmqGhnKG2r7OMnZyarJhiu7DAxGapnq6VlrmmsI5taGlvaGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html&text=Andre%20Bing%2c%20Walmart%20Gunman%20death%20Note%20Revealed%3a%20they%20Said%20I%20Was%20Like%20Jeffrey%20Dahmer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html&title=Andre%20Bing%2c%20Walmart%20Gunman%20death%20Note%20Revealed%3a%20they%20Said%20I%20Was%20Like%20Jeffrey%20Dahmer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html&title=Andre%20Bing%2c%20Walmart%20Gunman%20death%20Note%20Revealed%3a%20they%20Said%20I%20Was%20Like%20Jeffrey%20Dahmer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html&title=Andre%20Bing%2c%20Walmart%20Gunman%20death%20Note%20Revealed%3a%20they%20Said%20I%20Was%20Like%20Jeffrey%20Dahmer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwalmart-gunman-andre-bings-chilling-death-note-revealed.html&description=Andre%20Bing%2c%20Walmart%20Gunman%20death%20Note%20Revealed%3a%20they%20Said%20I%20Was%20Like%20Jeffrey%20Dahmer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./batman-25-review.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Batman #25 Review">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-otis-chicago-fire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Otis on Chicago Fire?
