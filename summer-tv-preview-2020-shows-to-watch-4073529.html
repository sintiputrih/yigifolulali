Chicago Fire alum <strong>Monica Raymund</strong> wows as Jackie Quiñones, Hightown’s flawed anti-hero struggling to stay sober. One of Hightown’s biggest strengths is its ensemble cast —<strong>&nbsp;James Badge Dale</strong>, <strong>Riley Voelkel</strong>, <strong>Shane Harper</strong>, and <strong>Amaury Nolasco</strong>. Take a trip to the Cape, TV fans. You won’t regret it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>The Bold Type (Freeform) — June 11<br></strong>Your favorite Scarlet girls are back for the second half of season 4.
