For example, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard come across as such <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lovable pair</a> that if they were ever to split up, there would be a whole lot of extremely disappointed people online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the vaunted place in society that most celebrities enjoy, at times it can be all too easy to forget that at the end of the day, they are human beings just like the rest of us. For example, some of the most beloved celebrity couples have gone on to break up even though at one time they seemed to have the perfect relationship.</p><p>Of all the beloved celebrity couples who’ve broken up, the most recent pair likely is Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudekis. While it is very sad that they ultimately couldn’t make things work, that doesn’t mean that their relationship deserves to be forgotten by the masses. In fact, even after Sudekis and Wilde’s split, it is interesting to learn how the former couple met in the first place.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity Couples Who Broke Up During Quarantine</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=previous-relationships>Previous Relationships</h2><p>Before Jason Sudekis and Olivia Wilde became a couple, they were both married to other people. In the case of Sudekis, in 2004 he married Kay Cannon, an actor, director, and writer who is best known for contributing scripts to 30 Rock and New Girl. After several years together, Sudekis and Cannon split in 2008 and divorced in 2010.</p><p>When Olivia Wilde was only 19-years-old, she got married to Tao Ruspoli in an abandoned school bus to keep their nuptials a secret. An Italian filmmaker and musician, Ruspoli notably is a member of an aristocratic family. After just over 8 years together, Wilde filed for divorce citing “irreconcilable differences.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Known Facts About Priyanka Chopra's Past Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=relationship-history>Relationship History</h2><p>In December 2011, Jason Sudekis and Olivia Wilde made headlines as a couple for the first time when Us Weekly reported on their relationship. Amazingly enough, it took nearly a year for either Olivia Wilde or Jason Sudekis to publicly address the fact that they were a couple and living together. While at an October 2012 event that was hosted by Glamour Magazine, Wilde stated that she was "blissfully, hopelessly, wildly in love" with Sudeikis. Roughly two months later, the couple made their red carpet debut at The American Museum of Natural History Gala. Unsurprisingly, Sudekis and Wilde were so gorgeous that they could compete with some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the best 2020 red carpet looks</a>.</p><p>In early 2013, Jason Sudekis got down on one knee and proposed to Olivia Wilde. However, unless the couple got wed in secret and never let the public know, Wilde and Sudekis never walked down the aisle together. Of course, you don’t have to be wed to build a life together and Sudekis and Wilde certainly did that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The parents of two kids together, Olivia Wilde gave birth to Jason Sudekis’ son in 2014 and they welcomed their daughter into the world in 2016. Additionally, in 2019 Wilde told Us Weekly that she and Sudekis still prioritized their romantic relationship. "We were both really social people when we met, and we didn't want to give that up when we became parents, so we're really consistent about our time with them, but we also prioritize a couple of date nights a week."</p><p>With that quote in mind, it seemed like Wilde and Sudekis could last as most celebrities who go the distance with their partner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">say similar things</a>. Sadly, in November 20202 it came out that Sudekis and Wilde had split. Even still, looking back at Jason Sudekis and Olivia Wilde’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship timeline</a>, they seem to have had a lot of great times together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Pop Star Power Couples That Ended In 2020</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-they-met>How They Met</h2><p>Long before Jason Sudekis and Olivia Wilde decided to split up, they met for the first time and fell in love. These days, a lot of celebrity couples <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meet over DMs</a>, but during a 2017 appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Sudekis spoke about how he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first came across Wilde</a> in person. "I met her at a finale party for SNL. We hit it off that night." However, Jason also revealed that at that time he’d been told that Olivia was in a relationship. Of course, over time they overcame that obstacle, and according to Jason, they wound up becoming a couple in part because of his busy schedule at that time.</p><p>“I actually came off looking a little cooler than I really am because I had heard through the grapevine, through mutual friends who weren’t exactly her best girlfriends, who would report back, ‘Oh you know, I think she’s dating someone,’ ” Sudekis explained. “So I didn’t make any moves. I was just very, very busy with other things. And next thing you know, I stopped being busy, she stopped dating someone, and then it was off to the races. ” “We sort of reintroduced ourselves.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For her part, Olivia Wilde told Allure that Jason Sudekis caught her eye immediately after they met but she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had to make the first move</a>. “I met Jason, and I thought he was so charming … but he didn’t even get my number. Over the next six months, we kept running into each other. [One night], my best guy friend walked up to him and said, ‘This is Olivia’s number. Use it.’ That was the beginning.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Sacha Baron Cohen And Isla Fisher Met</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalec6loK%2BhkWLEqrjDnmSappRit6K%2FzqdkrK2UmrastdJmpJ6dpGQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-did-olivia-wilde-and-jason-sudeikis-meet.html&text=How%20Did%20Olivia%20Wilde%20And%20Jason%20Sudeikis%20Meet%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-did-olivia-wilde-and-jason-sudeikis-meet.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-olivia-wilde-and-jason-sudeikis-meet.html&title=How%20Did%20Olivia%20Wilde%20And%20Jason%20Sudeikis%20Meet%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-did-olivia-wilde-and-jason-sudeikis-meet.html&title=How%20Did%20Olivia%20Wilde%20And%20Jason%20Sudeikis%20Meet%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-did-olivia-wilde-and-jason-sudeikis-meet.html&title=How%20Did%20Olivia%20Wilde%20And%20Jason%20Sudeikis%20Meet%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-did-olivia-wilde-and-jason-sudeikis-meet.html&description=How%20Did%20Olivia%20Wilde%20And%20Jason%20Sudeikis%20Meet%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jamie-lumley-age-how-old-is-joanna-lumley-son-in-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Lumley Age: How Old Is Joanna Lumley Son?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ck-hoffler-lawyer-wiki-who-is-she-married-to.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CK Hoffler Lawyer Wiki: Who Is She Married To?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
