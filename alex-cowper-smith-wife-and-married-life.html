He is said to have a $500,000 net worth as of 2024.</p><p>However, based on Celebrity Networth, his ex-wife Alice Eve is thought to be worth $46 million. She makes a substantial amount of money from her roles in films, TV series, endorsement deals, modeling contracts, and sponsorships.</p><h2><span id=Alex_Cowper-Smith_was_raised_in_the_United_Kingdom>Alex Cowper-Smith was raised in the United Kingdom.</span></h2><p>As previously said, Alex Cowper-Smith was born under the sign of Capricorn on January 1, 1970, in Hertfordshire, England, in the United Kingdom. His ethnicity is Caucasian and white, yet his nationality is English. He will be fifty-two years old in 2022, and his average height will be five feet five inches, or 170 cm.</p><p>Alex grew up with his parents in England, according to sources. He supposedly got along well with her mother and father, but he hasn’t shared many details about them with the public.</p><h2><span id=He_Has_a_Strong_Academic_Record>He Has a Strong Academic Record</span></h2><p>Smith attended the “Westminster School” for his elementary schooling. In 2000, he subsequently enrolled at the University of Nottingham. He graduated the next year with a degree in finance and business.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_the_Day_Job_of_Alex_Cowper-Smith>What Is the Day Job of Alex Cowper-Smith?</span></h2><p>The 52-year-old began working as soon as he graduated. He began his career as an associate at Goldman Sachs, a global investment bank and financial services provider.</p><p>Afterward, in 2015, Cowper-Smith received a promotion and joined the company’s finance team. He later quit the position for personal reasons. He is currently volunteering for the “British Red Cross Society”‘s fundraising webpage.</p><h2><span id=Alice_Eve8217s_ex-husband_Alex_When_And_How_Did_They_Meet>Alice Eve’s ex-husband, Alex: When And How Did They Meet?</span></h2><p>Alice Eve and Alex Cowper-Smith were best friends in high school. The couple first connected at Westminster School while they were in their teens.</p><p>After meeting as classmates, they finally started dating. Speaking of her connection to a magazine, she stated:</p><p>“When we were in school, we fell in love. After that, life proceeded as it had planned, and we both pursued our careers. I’ve always loved him, and at this point in our life, we were able to get back in touch and unexpectedly fell in love again.</p><p>But to start fresh after graduation, they mutually ended their relationship. Unexpectedly, the couple reconnected and carried on their romance from where it had left off.</p><h2><span id=Details_of_Alice_Eve8217s_wedding_and_engagement_to_Alex_Cowper-Smith>Details of Alice Eve’s wedding and engagement to Alex Cowper-Smith</span></h2><p>After reuniting, the teenage sweethearts went on a long-term relationship. While on vacation with the family in Ibiza, Alex asked Alice’s father for permission. At the “Village Underground” in London, they discreetly got engaged.</p><p>The couple first announced their engagement in July 2014. The rings were then exchanged by Cowper-Smith and Eve on December 31, 2014, at London’s Brompton Oratory.</p><p>Speaking of their wedding, it was a lavish event attended by their parents, close friends, and relatives. His then-fiance Eve looked stunning on their wedding day, wearing a white fur-trimmed jacket and hood over her lacy outfit.</p><p>The couple took a cab out of the marriage. The actress was always beaming and holding her bridal bouquet of white flowers as they made their way to the reception, while Alex was dressed elegantly in an evening coat and black tie as his best man was waiting for her.</p><h2><span id=Why_Did_the_pair_part_ways>Why Did the pair part ways?</span></h2><p>After getting married, Alex and Eve’s relationship had ups and downs. They couldn’t find time for one another because of their busy schedules and growing celebrity.</p><p>Cowper-Smith even resigned from his role as a financier in an attempt to save their union. Sadly, their marriage did not survive longer than three years, as they got divorced in 2017.</p><h2><span id=Actress_Alice_Eve_the_Ex-Wife_of_Alex_Cowper-Smith>Actress Alice Eve, the Ex-Wife of Alex Cowper-Smith</span></h2><p>Alex works as a professional banker, as was already indicated. But his bond with his ex-wife Alice Eve is the primary factor in his fame. Alice Eve, his former partner, is an actress who has been working in the business since 2004 and is based in London. She starred in several television dramas during her difficult times, including Hawking, Agatha Christie’s Point, and The Rotters’ Club.</p><p>Eventually, Alice began receiving offers for multiple roles, although she was only cast in a few. She starred in Big Nothing, Starter for 101, and Stage Beauty early in her career. Her portrayal as Esme/Alice in the play Rock ‘n’ Roll at the Royal Court Theatre garnered her a great deal of praise, and she was nominated for a Whatsonstage.com Theatregoers’ Choice Award for best supporting actress.</p><p>After playing Molly McCleish in the movie She’s Out of My League, Eve finally received her big break. She starred alongside Mike Vogel, Nate Torrence, and Jay Baruchel in the 2010 romantic comedy film. Her additional acting credits also include Iron Fist, Men in Black 3, Star Trek Into Darkness, and Before We Go.</p><h2><span id=Alex_Cowper-Smith_remarried_in_2021>Alex Cowper-Smith remarried in 2021</span></h2><p>In 2022, Alex is contentedly wed and a proud parent of a child. In 2021, he got married to Kim Cowper-Smith, his second wife.</p><p>Concerning his present spouse, Kim works as a social media coordinator at Socrates Communications. In the Western Cape of South Africa, in Cape Town, she was born. She also holds an advertising degree from AAA School.</p><p>The couple welcomed a child together in April 2021.
