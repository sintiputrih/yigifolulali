His oldest daughter was born to a woman he briefly dated, while his twins were with an actress named Beverly D'Angelo. Al Pacino's career had already taken off by the time he welcomed his first child, but his first child's mother wasn't exactly a celebrity. In 1989, when he was almost 50 years old, Al had his first child with an acting coach named Jan Tarrant. <span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Brief Look Into Al Pacino's Complicated Love Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's assumed that Jan and Al were together for just about a year, and it seems as if their daughter was not planned. Julie Marie Pacino was born in October 1989.</p><p>Today, Jan is still an acting and writing coach and her daughter dove into Hollywood, too.</p><h3 id=what-does-julie-pacino-do-for-a-living>What Does Julie Pacino Do For A Living?</h3><p><a href=#>Al Pacino's oldest daughter Julie</a> is a photographer and filmmaker, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">various producer and director credits</a> on a list of short films. Even without her dad's help getting jobs, it seems Julie has made her own way in the industry.</p><p>But although plenty of social media followers have inquired about Julie's feelings on having another younger sibling, she doesn't seem to engage with followers only interested in her dad's life.</p><h2 id=al-pacino-and-beverly-d-39-angelo-had-twins-together>Al Pacino And Beverly D'Angelo Had Twins Together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/beverly-d-angelo-and-al-pacino.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sometime after splitting from Jan Tarrant, Al Pacino began dating actress Beverly D'Angelo. <a href=#>Beverly was married when she met Al</a>, but she later explained that her marriage, which lasted from 1981 to 1995, was very much open.</p><p>Beverly recounted that most men she dated outside her marriage liked the arrangement, but Al was different. He wanted to get more serious with her, she said, and after three months together told her he wanted to have a family with her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Think This Is The Reason Al Pacino Decided To Never Get Married</a></span></p><p>It took the couple a few years to have their twins, conceived via IVF, who arrived right after Beverly turned 49. The twins were named Anton and Olivia; they were born in 2001.</p><p>By her own count, by age 51, she and Al had split. Ultimately, though Al Pacino offered to pay for baby expenses, their arrangement—which involved an accountant later convicted of a Ponzi scheme—fell apart when it appeared D'Angelo was overspending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also said that the pair had an acrimonious split, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">partly because of Beverly being "controlling."</a> Apparently, Al even accused Beverly of holding the twins hostage when they were little.</p><p>The custody battle ended in 2004 when the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">court determined a custody and support agreement for the exes</a>. Al Pacino had been paying $50K per month in child support for the twins. The court decision was not fully publicized, but it was stated that both halves of the former couple were happy with the results.</p><p>Some publications say Al had to pay more support after the court case, around $350K per month, but it's unclear where that figure comes from.</p><p>Leaving the courthouse, D'Angelo called the decision "terrific."</p><h3 id=who-are-al-pacino-39-s-twins>Who Are Al Pacino's Twins?</h3><p>Both of Al Pacino's twins are adults now, but <a href=#>Pacino explained that it was hard for his kids to go out in public</a> with him while they were growing up. Still, he involved his kids in awards shows and ceremonies, but Anton is far more private than both his sisters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Olivia Pacino has a decent Instagram following, and often shares about her adventures and exploits. One biography of Olivia claims she had learning issues in school, and began attending an alternative school as a result.</p><p>Olivia is said to be a photographer, and she has publicly been dating musician Ryan Harley for some time. The two appear to be engaged, as Olivia posed wearing an engagement ring for one photo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Al Pacino Absolutely Did Not Want To Win The Academy Award For Best Actor, Here's The Real Reason Why</a></span></p><p>As for Anton, he doesn't seem to have a social media presence, or if he does, he flies under the radar with a pseudonym. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his mom did reveal what her son does for a living</a> while the family attended a premier for a project of hers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beverly said her son "has a video game company" and noted that Olivia is "a live actor." She elaborated that the family was all involved in the industry, pointing out that in the past, her kids had attended premiers for their dad, but that now it was mom's turn.</p><p>At that time, it didn't seem that Beverly held any ill will against Al, though she's likely just as surprised by his baby news as anyone else—especially because Al's girlfriend is much younger than him. <a href=#>Noor Alfallah has also dated other much-older stars</a>, but apparently, Al is happy with their relationship and having a fourth baby in his 80s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecClZKmZk567sHnKopusZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-are-al-pacino-kids.html&text=What%20We%20Know%20About%20Al%20Pacino%27s%20Three%20Adult%20Children%20Amid%20His%20Baby%20News&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-are-al-pacino-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-al-pacino-kids.html&title=What%20We%20Know%20About%20Al%20Pacino%27s%20Three%20Adult%20Children%20Amid%20His%20Baby%20News" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-are-al-pacino-kids.html&title=What%20We%20Know%20About%20Al%20Pacino%27s%20Three%20Adult%20Children%20Amid%20His%20Baby%20News" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-are-al-pacino-kids.html&title=What%20We%20Know%20About%20Al%20Pacino%27s%20Three%20Adult%20Children%20Amid%20His%20Baby%20News" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-are-al-pacino-kids.html&description=What%20We%20Know%20About%20Al%20Pacino%27s%20Three%20Adult%20Children%20Amid%20His%20Baby%20News" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-are-neiman-gracie-parents-facts-to-know-about-the-ufc-fighter-230068-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Neiman Gracie Parents?
