I did inherit his competitive nature. At my house, winning is the only option”. She added, “I was born before he became successful so I got to witness the entire rise from an unknown to known. Don’t let my kindness fool you. I used to be an attorney and know how to win. I am so competitive that I hurt feelings”.</p><p>Brittany is one of the 12 contestants in season 1 of ABC’s show <a href=#>Claim To Fame</a>.
