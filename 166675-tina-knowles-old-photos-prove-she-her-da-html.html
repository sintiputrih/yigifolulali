Not only they received her support during their careers but also inherited her beauty, and Tina’s old photos prove it.</p><p class=Fg>Célestine Ann Beyincé, best known as Tina Knowles, was born in Texas on January 4, 1954. Even though she was never a recognized name in the entertainment industry, Tina was part of a singing group during her high school years. It was called the <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/its-a-family-affair/>Veltones</a>, and The Supremes inspired them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/efd913d3b93c01298eb30ed9d3e580353224111565713135.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Tina Knowles at the Fifth Annual ACE Awards on November 6, 2001 in New York City | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>MAKING A NAME FOR HERSELF</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>When she was 19 years old, she moved to California to work as a <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/fashion/tina-knowles-lawson-beyonce-solange-matriarch.html>makeup artist</a> for the Japanese personal care company Shiseido. Unfortunately, she had to go back to Texas only one year after landing her spot in the business due to her parents’ health problems.</p><p class=Fg>Her experience in Shiseido was enough for her to open a 12-seat hair salon in Houston called Headliners. Since it became one of the most popular hair businesses in Houston, it helped her family to afford an upper-class lifestyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/38ff7845e2ff55810bb2e323993ddb8f2063851565713594.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Tina Knowles and Solange at EMM Group's THE Estate on July 18, 2008 in Bridgehampton, New York | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>USING BEYONCÉ’S MOMENTUM</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Tina Lawson rose to fame thanks to Destiny’s Child, the girl group which best-known line-up was formed by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. When money was still an issue in their lives, Tina used to design costumes and outfits that the members of the group would wear for their concerts and different events.</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>REACHING THE PEAK OF HER CAREER</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>The style that the group wore through Tina was later known as the “Bootylicious touch.” Tina admitted that they looked “a little crazy sometimes” but that people always wanted to see “what they were going to wear next.”</p><p class=Fg>Eventually, the group’s popularity skyrocketed, and Tina became a fashion force, what drove her and Beyoncé to create a low-priced clothing brand in 2004 called House of Deréon, named after Tina’s mother.</p><p class=Fg>In 2005, when Destiny’s Child disbanded and Beyoncé followed a solo career, Tina Lawson kept designing outfits for her. One of the most memorable ones was the black gown that “Queen Bey” wore for the 2005 Academy Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a1a4d1e5e28f5da9ddb6e2485c87db582816231565713749.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Beyoncé during the 77th Annual Academy Awards at the Kodak Theater on February 27, 2005 in Hollywood, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>STEPPING OUT OF THE FASHION WORLD</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Unfortunately, in 2009, when the career of Beyoncé’s mom was at its peak, she and her husband Mathew Knowles split. Even though they had spent 33 years together, they admitted to having “conflict of personalities.” In 2011, the divorce was made final.</p><p class=Fg>“All these things that I love — going to art shows, reading art books, going out dancing — I had stopped.
