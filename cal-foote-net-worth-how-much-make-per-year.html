He was drafted 27th overall in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning</p><p>Foote is the son of former NHL player Adam Foote, who is now an assistant coach with the Vancouver Canucks. Adam had a fantastic reputation as a defenseman during his tenure in the NHL, making it tough for Cal to match.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/26175540/Cal-Foote-parents.jpg><p>He was drafted 8 picks higher than his father was in 1989 when his father was drafted 22nd overall by the Quebec Nordiques.</p><p>Cal&nbsp;Foote&nbsp;does not have a wife and has not married his long-term lover,&nbsp;Julia Wrobel.</p><p>Cal Foote, 25, debuted in the National Hockey League against the Chicago Blackhawks during the 2020 season. The Tampa Bay Lightning selected the defenseman 14th overall in the 2017 NHL draft.&nbsp;Foote began his AHL career with the Syracuse Crunch before moving on to the NHL</p><p>The Lightning traded Foote to the Nashville Predators halfway through the 2022 season in exchange for Tanner Jeannot. Foote played 24 games during his short stay in Nashville and signed with the New Jersey Devils in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>However, despite the fact that his career has yet to take off, Foote seems to have already tarnished his reputation. Foote and colleague Michael McLeod have been given an indefinite leave of absence from the squad.</p><p>The New Jersey Devils announced on Wednesday. The move was made after The Globe and Mail revealed that five members of the 2018 junior hockey team were scheduled to face sexual assault charges in London, Ontario, Canada.</p><p>Cal Foote has struggled to make an impression in the NHL since making his debut with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020. And now, the 25-year-old seems to be involved in a police probe into the sexual assault of five Canadian World Junior team members in 2018.</p><p>Undergoes finger surgery&nbsp;Foote underwent surgery to repair a tendon in his pinkie finger and will likely miss the first 2-4 weeks of the season, Joe Smith of The Athletic reports.</p><p>Cal Foote was named captain of the Kelowna Rockets on September 22, 2017.&nbsp;Foote was the 23rd franchise captain.&nbsp;The Tampa Bay Lightning signed Foote to a three-year, entry-level contract on April 1, 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/26175548/Cal-Foote6.jpg><p>The New Jersey Devils star has attempted to keep his dating life out of the public eye. His final Instagram post was with his girlfriend. Since then, the defenseman has attempted to keep his social media presence low-key</p><p>The couple made their romance public in October 2022. On Instagram, the hockey star published a selfie of himself and Julia, who were most likely attending an afternoon meal gathering.</p><p>The duo was colour-matched, with Wrobel wearing a short blue flowery dress and Foote in a blue suit and white shirt. The hockey player chose not to wear a tie, resulting in an easygoing appearance.&nbsp;Cal captioned the image with a single red heart emoji, and Julia responded with a happy heart emoji. Cal’s second image of him and Julia was shared on August 31, 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>The two wore colour-coordinated outfits to an event at Whistle Bear Golf Club. This is Cal’s final Instagram post, and he has restricted the number of comments.&nbsp;If Julia’s Instagram account had been made public, we would have learned more about her. Julia’s surname, Wrobel, has Polish origins, so it wouldn’t be surprising if her family eventually relocated to the United States</p><p>He does not have a child.</p><p>Source;<strong><a href=#>Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpyYpWWWpLy1sYynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMoaawZZ2qsKl5zJqinmWgmr9uxcSaqWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcal-foote-net-worth-how-much-make-per-year.html&text=Cal%20Foote%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20much%20does%20Cal%20Foote%20make%20per%20year%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcal-foote-net-worth-how-much-make-per-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcal-foote-net-worth-how-much-make-per-year.html&title=Cal%20Foote%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20much%20does%20Cal%20Foote%20make%20per%20year%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcal-foote-net-worth-how-much-make-per-year.html&title=Cal%20Foote%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20much%20does%20Cal%20Foote%20make%20per%20year%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcal-foote-net-worth-how-much-make-per-year.html&title=Cal%20Foote%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20much%20does%20Cal%20Foote%20make%20per%20year%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcal-foote-net-worth-how-much-make-per-year.html&description=Cal%20Foote%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20much%20does%20Cal%20Foote%20make%20per%20year%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gary-wright-obituary-remembering-the-late-singer-and-musician.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gary Wright Obituary: Remembering The Late Singer And Musician">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./where-did-kevin-gates-grow-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where did Kevin Gates grow up?
