The exes had three children: sons Dade and Kobe and daughter Kaya.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THE COUPLE'S WEDDING</strong></p><p class=Fg>On December 15, 2012, Faison and Cobb became husband and wife at the home of Faison's "Scrubs" co-star Zach Braff, who was also the groomsman. <a class="Xd a" href=#>Jessica Simpson</a>, Cobb's best friend, served as maid of honor.</p><p class=Fg>At the time of the wedding, one of the guests <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/donald-faison-and-cacee-cobbs-wedding-all-the-details/>told</a> People magazine that Simpson talked about her and Cobb's long friendship and how honored the singer and actress is to have Cobb as the godmother to her daughter.</p><p class=Fg>Faison and Cobb's wedding was a Southern affair, even if it was held in Los Angeles. Cobb wanted a backyard wedding in the Southern tradition, said Paige Appel of Bash, Please, the event company organizing the nuptials.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>In an interview with People back in 2019, Faison said he does not discipline his children often.</strong></h3><p class=Fg>In a strapless gown, Cobb made her way down the aisle, escorted by her father, Ed Cobb. Also attending were Stacey Dash, Ashlee Simpson, Breckin Meyer, Seth Green, Sarah Chalke, and Elisa Donovan.</p><p class=Fg>The ceremony featured personal vows recited by Cobb and Faison. Moreover, a gospel choir performed their favorite songs and also incorporated the tradition of "jumping the broom."</p><p class=Fg>All night, everyone danced to Knyght Ryder's music. To top it all off, attendees took home a parting gift inspired by Faison's favorite food, a jar containing a yellow birthday cake with white frosting.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THEY ARE STILL INSEPARABLE</strong></p><p class=Fg>It has been nine years since they were married, and their relationship remains steadfast. Many of Faison's adorable Instagram photos showcase how happy they are to be together as a family.</p><p class=Fg>Faison <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/COp3EPwL1Kl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">posted</a> a picture of his wife and their children in May to wish her a Happy Mother's Day. Tagging Cobb to the post, the actor wrote, "You're simply the best!" All three have smiles on their faces.</p><p class=Fg>In June, the actor <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CQTvOFWrzaq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">shared</a> a selfie with his wife with the caption "Ride or Die." And in February, Cobb <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLKdoq8gSZT/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">uploaded</a> a photo with her family.

However, the actor <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/donald-faison-parenting-six-kids-disney-dad-discipline-exclusive/>confessed</a> that when it comes to punishing his bundles of joy, he lacks experience.</p><p class=Fg>In an interview with People back in 2019, Faison said he does not discipline his children often. Since his children have gotten older, he said he has become less opinionated. The actor <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/donald-faison-parenting-six-kids-disney-dad-discipline-exclusive/>added</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"But I feel like I've had to use my experiences in life to explain to them why what they're doing isn't going to work."</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>PAYING TRIBUTE TO HIS EX</strong></p><p class=Fg>In 2017, Faison became a media focus following the death of his ex-wife Askey under mysterious circumstances. Along with a moving image, he <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/donald-faison-mourns-death-ex-wife-lisa-askey-touching-tribute/>wrote</a> a heartbreaking post about the loss of his children's mother.</p><p class=Fg><a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRHbabTBvj5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">According</a> to Faison, he and Askey "never really saw eye to eye," but one thing they had in common was their love of their children.
