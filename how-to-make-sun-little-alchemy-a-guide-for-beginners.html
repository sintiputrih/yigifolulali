You can start with four basic elements: air, earth, fire, and water, and use them to make hundreds of items, from animals and plants to planets and stars. One of the most fascinating items you can make in Little Alchemy is the sun, which is essential for life on Earth and many other items in the game. In this article, we will show you how to make sun little alchemy in three different ways, using simple combinations of elements. We will also give you some tips and tricks on how to use the sun to make other interesting items.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to Make Sun Little Alchemy: Method 1</strong></h2><p>The first method to make sun little alchemy is to combine fire and sky. Fire is one of the basic elements that you start with, and sky is an item that you can make by combining air and cloud. Cloud is another item that you can make by combining air and steam. Steam is an item that you can make by combining fire and water. So, the steps to make sun little alchemy using this method are:</p><ul><li>Combine fire and water to make steam.</li><li>Combine air and steam to make cloud.</li><li>Combine air and cloud to make sky.</li><li>Combine fire and sky to make sun.</li></ul><p>This method is easy and straightforward, but it requires four steps and six elements. If you want a faster way to make sun little alchemy, you can try the next method.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to Make Sun Little Alchemy: Method 2</strong></h2><p>The second method to make sun little alchemy is to combine fire and planet. Planet is an item that you can make by combining earth and space. Space is an item that you can make by combining sky and star. Star is an item that you can make by combining night and telescope. Night is an item that you can make by combining moon and time. Moon is an item that you can make by combining sky and cheese. Cheese is an item that you can make by combining milk and bacteria. Milk is an item that you can make by combining cow and grass. Cow is an item that you can make by combining livestock and grass. Livestock is an item that you can make by combining farmer and life. Farmer is an item that you can make by combining human and field. Human is an item that you can make by combining life and clay. Life is an item that you can make by combining energy and swamp. Energy is an item that you can make by combining fire and plant. Plant is an item that you can make by combining rain and earth. Rain is an item that you can make by combining water and cloud. So, the steps to make sun little alchemy using this method are:</p><ul><li>Combine fire and water to make steam.</li><li>Combine air and steam to make cloud.</li><li>Combine water and cloud to make rain.</li><li>Combine rain and earth to make plant.</li><li>Combine fire and plant to make energy.</li><li>Combine energy and swamp to make life.</li><li>Combine life and clay to make human.</li><li>Combine human and field to make farmer.</li><li>Combine farmer and life to make livestock.</li><li>Combine livestock and grass to make cow.</li><li>Combine cow and grass to make milk.</li><li>Combine milk and bacteria to make cheese.</li><li>Combine cheese and sky to make moon.</li><li>Combine moon and time to make night.</li><li>Combine night and telescope to make star.</li><li>Combine star and sky to make space.</li><li>Combine space and earth to make planet.</li><li>Combine fire and planet to make sun.</li></ul><p>This method is more complicated than the first one, but it requires fewer steps (18) and fewer elements (14). However, it also involves some items that are not very intuitive, such as cheese, bacteria, telescope, etc. If you want a simpler way to make sun little alchemy, you can try the third method.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to Make Sun Little Alchemy: Method 3</strong></h2><p>The third method to make sun little alchemy is to combine light bulb and solar system. Light bulb is an item that you can make by combining electricity and glass. Electricity is an item that you can make by combining metal and energy. Metal is an item that you can make by combining stone and fire. Stone is an item that you can make by combining earth and pressure. Pressure is an item that you can make by combining earth and earth. Glass is an item that you can make by combining sand and fire. Sand is an item that you can make by combining stone and wind. Wind is an item that you can make by combining air and motion. Motion is an item that you can make by combining time and wind. Time is an item that you can make by combining sun and sand. Solar system is an item that you can make by combining sun and planet. So, the steps to make sun little alchemy using this method are:</p><ul><li>Combine earth and earth to make pressure.</li><li>Combine earth and pressure to make stone.</li><li>Combine stone and fire to make metal.</li><li>Combine metal and energy to make electricity.</li><li>Combine stone and wind to make sand.</li><li>Combine sand and fire to make glass.</li><li>Combine electricity and glass to make light bulb.</li><li>Combine sun and planet to make solar system.</li><li>Combine light bulb and solar system to make sun.</li></ul><p>This method is the simplest and fastest way to make sun little alchemy, as it only requires nine steps and nine elements. However, it also involves some items that are circular, such as sun, time, and solar system. This means that you need to have the sun already in order to make the sun using this method. This may seem paradoxical, but it is possible in Little Alchemy, as you can use different combinations of elements to make the same item.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How to Use Sun Little Alchemy: Tips and Tricks</strong></h2><p>Now that you know how to make sun little alchemy, you can use it to create many other items in the game. Here are some examples of what you can do with the sun:</p><ul><li>Combine sun and water to make rainbow.</li><li>Combine sun and grass to make flower.</li><li>Combine sun and flower to make sunflower.</li><li>Combine sun and snowman to make carrot.</li><li>Combine sun and tree to make fruit.</li><li>Combine sun and fruit to make juice.</li></ul><p>These are just some of the possibilities that you can explore with the sun. You can also try to combine the sun with other items that you have made or found in the game, and see what happens. You may discover some surprising results or some hidden items that are not listed in the official cheatsheet. According to sitename<a href=# rel=noopener>1</a>, there are 580 items in total in Little Alchemy, so there is a lot of room for experimentation and creativity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Little Alchemy is a game that challenges your imagination and logic skills, as you try to create new items from basic elements.
