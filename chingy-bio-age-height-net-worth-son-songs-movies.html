His debut album in 2003,&nbsp;Jackpot, sold two million copies.</p><p>A second album,&nbsp;Powerballin’, was released to mixed reviews on November 16, 2004, through Capitol Records and Chingy’s Slot-A-Lot label. His 2006 release&nbsp;Hoodstar&nbsp;spawned the hit singles named “Pullin’ Me Back” and “Dem Jeans.” Chingy released&nbsp;2007 Hate It or Love It, under DTP records.

The up-tempo Southern hip hop track “Right Thurr” gained popularity, and peaked at number two on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100.</p><p><strong><span>2003:&nbsp;Jackpot</span></strong></p><p>On July 15, 2003, Chingy’s debut album&nbsp;Jackpot&nbsp;was released on Disturbing tha Peace. Ludacris negotiated a deal to distribute the album through&nbsp;Capitol Records since he was unable to secure a distribution deal through&nbsp;Def Jam. The guest appearances included Ludacris,&nbsp;Snoop Dogg,&nbsp;Murphy Lee,&nbsp;I-20, Raindrop,&nbsp;Tity Boi&nbsp;of&nbsp;Playaz Circle,&nbsp;Trina, and&nbsp;Jermaine Dupri.</p><p>Fueled by “Right Thurr”,&nbsp;Jackpot&nbsp;produced the hit “One Call Away” which featured J-Weav&nbsp;and “Holidae In” featuring Snoop Dogg and Ludacris. The next album The Trak Starz was produced by St. Louis production crew. The album was well received by critics which was certified&nbsp;Platinum&nbsp;by the&nbsp;RIAA within one year of the release of&nbsp;Jackpot.</p><p><strong><span>2004–2005:&nbsp;Powerballin’</span></strong></p><p>Chingy released his second album,&nbsp;Powerballin’, on November 16, 2004 through Slot-A-Lot Records and Capitol Records. The album peaked at #10 on the charts and featured the hit single “Balla Baby.” The album featured guest appearances from artists such as R. Kelly,&nbsp;Bun B,&nbsp;Lil Wayne,&nbsp;Lil Flip,&nbsp;Janet Jackson and David Banner,&nbsp;Nate Dogg, and Get It Boyz.

The album featured&nbsp;Mr. Collipark, who was longtime collaborator&nbsp;Jermaine Dupri,&nbsp;Timbaland, and&nbsp;Mannie Fresh. His summer single, “Pullin Me Back” (featuring actor-R&B singer&nbsp;Tyrese), would find him back on top on the Hot Rap Tracks chart and help&nbsp;Hoodstar&nbsp;debut at number eight on its chart, but the follow-up single “Dem Jeans”, which featured Jermaine Dupri, fared worse although the album did go gold. The other singles from&nbsp;Hoodstar&nbsp;were “Brand New Kicks” and “Hands Up”.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2007%e2%80%932008-hate-it-or-love-it></span><span>2007–2008:&nbsp;Hate It or Love It</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chingy was not happy with the way he felt Capitol was promoting their urban artists. In 2007 he jumped ship and returned to DTP Records, which was then a part of the Def Jam family. When asked about his move, the St. Louis rapper reported “I don’t think Capitol really knew how to work urban artists, They’re really stuck on pop and they didn’t know how to market me.”</p><p>Chingy’s fourth studio album Hate It or Love It featured production from&nbsp;Scott Storch,&nbsp;Timbaland, and&nbsp;Cool and Dre. The lead single “Fly Like Me”, featured Amerie. It was released on December 18, 2007 featuring&nbsp; appearances by&nbsp;Ludacris,&nbsp;Bobby Valentino,&nbsp;Steph Jones,&nbsp;Trey Songz,&nbsp;Rick Ross, and&nbsp;Anthony Hamilton.</p><p>The album debuted at 84 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;200, selling 30,000 copies, making it his first album not to crack the Top 10.&nbsp;Hate It or Love It&nbsp;was not released in the UK, marking Chingy’s first albumoutside the country.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2010%e2%80%932013-no-risk-no-reward></span><span>2010–2013&nbsp;No Risk, No Reward</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2012 Chingy announced he was working on his next (fifth) studio album called&nbsp;No Risk No Reward, DTP which was set to be released in the year 2012, but as of June 2016 continues to be delayed due to lack of funding. “Superhero”, featured Full Dekk Music Group’s artist Chris Woodhouse, and was purported to be the first single from his album.</p><p>Chingy then announced that he would release a mixtape entitled&nbsp;Jackpot Back. It was released on March 3, 2012. Chingy’s upcoming EP album entitled&nbsp;Chingology was released later that year.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2013%e2%80%932014-%e2%80%9cking-judah%e2%80%9d-and-%e2%80%9cwatch-the-world%e2%80%9d></span><span>2013–2014: “King Judah” and “Watch The World”</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In Spring 2013, Chingy announced that he claimed the belief of&nbsp;Black Hebrew Israelites&nbsp; and released the music video for “King Judah”. This was his attempt to follow a moral agenda and denouncing mainstream rap. Major media outlets in Australia and NZ leaked the information about a new Chingy collaboration entitled “Watch The World” featuring New Zealand based Asian model/singer Lucy X (Lucy Xu) .</p><p>The track produced by Christopher Kris (Kris Lal) had a rumor to be featured on an upcoming compilation album which was released in 2014.
