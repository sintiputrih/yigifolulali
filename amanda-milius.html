She is sensitive about her personal life and has not even disclosed her birthdate in public. Amanda Milius is thought to be exceptional in the same way as her father, John Milius, who is a spectacular filmmaker and screenwriter best known for Apocalypse Now, Dirty Harry, Big Wednesday, and many other films. She works as a director, producer, and writer.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Amanda_Milius_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Amanda Milius? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Amanda Milius has worked in Hollywood for nearly a decade, and despite being the daughter of a great screenwriter, she has never been accused of nepotism. Her age is unclear, but she may be in her early thirties because she directed only one thesis film during her undergraduate years and is currently editing her next documentary about the collapse of democracy. She may or may not have made money, but because her parents are such tremendous celebrities, she is financially secure. She isn’t working for money, but rather making films that expose the dark and terrible truth of politics in government.</p><h2><span id=Amanda_Milius-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings>Amanda Milius- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings</span></h2><p>Amanda was born in Los Angeles in 1985-86 and is 36 years old, according to online data. Despite having spent a portion of her childhood in Woodland Hills, she now resides in Washington, D.C. She grew up with her father, the famed director, and screenwriter John Milius, who is highly recognized for his directing all over the world, and her mother, Celia Kaye, who is also a well-known actress. Amanda completed her studies at the New School University, where she concentrated on Philosophy and Film. Later, she enrolled in the USC School of Cinematic Arts, where she completed her thesis film “The Lotus Gun” for her USC MFA degree in 2015, which will be shown at upcoming film festivals and screenings throughout the world.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Amanda Milius</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1985-86</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>36 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Los Angeles, California, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Residence</td><td>Washington DC, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Film Director</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Amanda_Milius-_Relationship_Married_Life>Amanda Milius- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>We know Amanda is quite private about her life, so she hasn’t spoken anything about her love life or any previous relationships. It is difficult to obtain information on her romantic life, although she is thought to be unmarried because she is focused on directing her pro-Trump Russiagate documentary “The Plot Against the President.”</p><h2><span id=Amanda_Milius-_Professional_Career>Amanda Milius- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Amanda graduated from the USC School of Cinematic Arts, where she worked on her thesis film “The Lotus Gun.” During that period, she worked as a fashion photographer side by side, and in her spare time, she focused on writing short films on the counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s and how it affected present society. During her time at USC, she was fascinated by the psychology of four strong female protagonist characters in films such as Duel, Silver Beach, Disconnect, and Maneater who thrive in difficult terrain and surroundings.</p><h2><span id=Documentary_on_the_President>Documentary on the President</span></h2><p>She recently resigned from her position as deputy assistant secretary for content in the State Department’s Bureau of Global Public Affairs in order to surreptitiously create a pro-Trump documentary. She is now working on the pro-Trump Russiagate documentary “The Plot Against the President,” which is based on Lee Smith’s 2019 best-selling book of the same name. During the previous months, she was busy interviewing Russiagate detractors, including Rep. She didn’t even provide an interview to Gen. Michael Flynn’s attorney, Sidney Powell.</p><p>She has 70 hours of these interviews and is currently editing them for her documentary film. According to her, this film’should appeal to people other than conservatives and is important to both Republicans and Democrats.’ The arm and cable group of progressive commentators and academy members, including Glenn Greenwald and Stephen F. Cohen, have expressed their scepticism and fury about Russiagate. They were particularly concerned about the intelligence community’s deceptions during the Trump campaign’s surveillance in 2016.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><ul><li>During her academic days, Amanda created a “thesis” film called “The Lotus Gun.”</li><li>Her film “thesis” will be shown at upcoming film festivals and screenings.</li><li>She is currently working on a pro-Trump Russiagate documentary titled “The Plot Against the President,” which is set to be released in the coming days.</li><li>During her student years, she also worked as a fashion photographer.</li><li>Amanda is the daughter of a great screenwriter and director of films such as Apocalypse Now, but she is still finding her way.</li></ul><p><span style=font-size:18pt><span style=font-weight:400>Read More: </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Marli Alexa</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>,</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400> Lauren Swickard</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Leesa Ranganathan</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>,</span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400> Bella Poarch</span></a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>film director</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Fernand Melgar</a></h3>Fernand Melgar estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
