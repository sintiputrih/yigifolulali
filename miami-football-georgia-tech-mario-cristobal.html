Nothing would have.</p><p>Mario Cristobal blew it.</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=176 href=#>Miami</a> lost a game it shouldn‚Äôt have, in stunningly idiotic fashion.</p><p>If quarterback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ejiO4AQaMdtllM1B href=#>Tyler Van Dyke</a> is ordered to take a knee on a third-and-10 with the clock running under 40 seconds, the Hurricanes are 5-0 and talking about how they escaped with an ugly 20-17 win over <a class=ath_autolink data-id=172 href=#>Georgia Tech</a>.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Instead, the sports world is wondering why he handed the ball off to Don Chaney Jr. with the Yellow Jackets out of timeouts, leading to <a href=# rel=noopener>the fumble that set up the Yellow Jackets‚Äô miracle comeback</a>.</p><p>Surely, Cristobal had to have thought Georgia Tech had another timeout, right? Nope.</p><p>‚ÄúThere was no confusion out there,‚Äù he said.</p><p>No, this was just stupid stuff.</p><p>When asked directly about it after the game, Cristobal denied that the Hurricanes ran one more play because Chaney was closing in on the first 100-yard rushing game of his career. Chaney was sitting on 99 yards when he carried it for the final time. Miami‚Äôs official stats later reflected that Chaney finished with 106 yards. But in real-time, before his final carry, Miami‚Äôs official stats listed him at 99.</p><p>Chaney picked up four yards on his final touch but was stripped of the ball as he went to the ground. It appeared his left elbow might have hit the turf before the ball was pried free. But officials reviewed the fumble, and the play stood as called on the field.</p><p>Again, why did Miami not take a knee?</p><p>‚ÄúWe were moving the pile and we had a pretty good drive going,‚Äù Cristobal said before pausing. ‚ÄúI am not going to make an excuse for it and say we should have done this or that. Sometimes we can get carried away. But I should have just stepped in and said, ‚ÄòHey, take a knee.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p>Instead, one of the most unimaginable and embarrassing losses in Hurricanes history took place.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Orlando‚Äôs own üòé<a href=#>@ChristianLeary4</a> called game</p><p>üì∫ <a href=#>@accnetwork</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/sj1LyCfRbf</a></p><p>‚Äî Georgia Tech Football (@GeorgiaTechFB) <a href=#>October 8, 2023</a></p><p>It‚Äôs a mistake you‚Äôd think every coach would try his best to avoid. Cristobal, though, has fallen victim to running an unnecessary play in a clock-killing situation twice now. It happened to his team at Oregon in 2018.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The <a class=ath_autolink data-id=243 href=#>Ducks</a> led <a class=ath_autolink data-id=248 href=#>Stanford</a> 31-28 late, and quarterback Justin Herbert could have knelt to run the clock down to 16 or fewer seconds and set up a punt near midfield. Instead, Oregon running back <a class=ath_autolink data-id=olK99SorB2IeQjBe href=#>CJ Verdell</a> ran it on second-and-2 and fumbled. The Cardinal took over with 51 seconds remaining,&nbsp; forced overtime and went on to beat the Ducks 38-31.</p><p>Cristobal‚Äôs explanation about Saturday‚Äôs clock management strategy on the final drive didn‚Äôt make much sense. Why would any coach in their right mind run it on third-and-10 with 33 seconds left in the game after Georgia Tech had used its final timeout two plays earlier?</p><p>‚ÄúWhen the drive started, it was going to be at the 1:57 mark and we could burn about 1:27 off and then it was recalibrated,‚Äù Cristobal said of the clock.</p><p>Recalibrated?</p><p>‚ÄúWe should have taken a timeout there at the end,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe thought he could get the first down and we talked about two hands on the ball, but that isn‚Äôt good enough. That‚Äôs it, we fumbled the ball and they went 75 yards in two plays. There is no excuse.‚Äù</p><p>What were the final 26 seconds like for the guy in charge on the other sideline? Well, Georgia Tech coach Brent Key was stunned Miami didn‚Äôt take a knee either. Surprise turned to elation when his team pounced on its opportunity, as <a class=ath_autolink data-id=f1izADdSG1rFto3P href=#>Haynes King</a> connected with <a class=ath_autolink data-id=6Sn4faPdvgEBuGTR href=#>Christian Leary</a> on the game-winning 44-yard touchdown pass with two seconds left.</p><p>‚ÄúI usually have a pretty good recollection of the game, but what does Will Ferrell say in ‚ÄòOld School‚Äô? I think I just blacked out,‚Äù Key said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I felt like right then.‚Äù</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Auerbach's Top 10: Oklahoma rockets to No. 1 after Week 6 thrillers</p></a><p>Miami hasn‚Äôt won an ACC home game yet under Cristobal. They‚Äôre 0-5 in league play at Hard Rock Stadium since school administrators signed the coach to a 10-year, $80 million deal in December 2021, replacing Manny Diaz, who is now <a class=ath_autolink data-id=193 href=#>Penn State</a>‚Äôs ballyhooed defensive coordinator.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Cristobal can recruit in ways Diaz couldn‚Äôt: Miami signed the seventh-best class in the country last cycle, the best signing class for the program in the last 15 years. And the Hurricanes seemed to be getting the attention of more top recruits after last year‚Äôs 5-7 meltdown. Miami had an audience full of recruits in attendance Saturday, including the best high school receiver in the country, Jeremiah Smith, a hometown product from a family of Canes fans who has been committed to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=191 href=#>Ohio State</a> since December. Smith told The Athletic in March he wanted to see what Miami would do in Cristobal‚Äôs second season, whether the coach could really turn the program around and make the offense elite again.</p><p>It‚Äôs hard to imagine Smith left Saturday‚Äôs game impressed on either front. Van Dyke performed nothing like the quarterback who came in ranked No. 2 in the FBS in passing efficiency. He threw three interceptions and probably had a fourth pick dropped. Newly appointed Yellow Jackets defensive coordinator Kevin Sherrer ‚Äî and we mean promoted to take over last week, after a loss to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=223 href=#>Bowling Green</a> ‚Äî figured out how to frustrate Van Dyke rather easily.</p><p>Van Dyke forced the ball into tight coverage windows and paid for it repeatedly. But he also admitted the coverage schemes weren‚Äôt complicated.</p><p>‚ÄúIt really sucks. It really does,‚Äù Van Dyke said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still seven games left in the season. There‚Äôs still a lot in front of us. We can‚Äôt just dwell on this one loss and say our season is over.‚Äù</p><p>The thing is, it‚Äôs hard to believe the Hurricanes can prevent what happened to them Saturday from sending this season off the rails. For all the preseason talk about their expanded team leadership council, they looked like the same unprepared team coming off an idle week that they‚Äôve been for the better part of the last decade.</p><p>Saturday‚Äôs game-winning touchdown was surrendered because All-American safety Kam Kinchens allowed Leary to get behind him in what was supposed to be prevent coverage. Kinchens is the heart and soul of Miami‚Äôs team. He‚Äôs not supposed to be making those mistakes. Yet it happened.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>College football Week 6 results and takeaways: Texas A&M's what-ifs, OU's magical finish</p></a><p>North Carolina is up next; the unbeaten <a class=ath_autolink data-id=174 href=#>Tar Heels</a> pounded <a class=ath_autolink data-id=167 href=#>Syracuse</a> 40-7 on Saturday.
