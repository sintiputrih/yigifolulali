However, as a kid, the golfer was more into tennis and basketball and hoped to pursue them professionally someday.&nbsp;</p><p>The PGA player attended Seminole High School and graduated in 1996. Afterward, he chose to go to the Georgia Institute of Technology and enrolled in their golf program.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Matt-Kuchar-Father.jpg><p>Matt had a great collegiate career with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets as he became a two-time first-team All-American. Furthermore, Matt graduated college with a degree in business management.&nbsp;</p><p>He won the 1997 U.S. Amateur championship as an amateur after losing the 1996 championship to <a href=# rel=noopener>Tiger Woods</a> in the semi-finals. Moreover, Peter caddied for him during the championship in 1998.</p><p>Since Peter celebrated his son’s shots and won loudly, he received quite a few criticizations for his behavior. Nevertheless, the father did not care about the criticizations and said,&nbsp;</p><p>“Your son just chipped in for birdie. What are you going to do? Stand there and pretend you’re at a funeral?”</p><p>Likewise, Matt liked that his dad celebrated his shots which increased their father-son bonding even more.
