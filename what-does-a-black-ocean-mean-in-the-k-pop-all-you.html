The first time was at the Golden Disc Awards, where they played for a largely dark crowd, save for the purple lights of their own ARMY followers. They encountered a comparable circumstance the second time around at the Melon Music Awards.</p><p>According to rumours, the black ocean was the result of a fan conflict between BTS and EXO, a well-known rival K-pop group, for accolades and recognition. When one group performed, both sides blamed the other for turning off their lightsticks, which led to a dark ocean for both groups.</p><p>The black ocean did not, however, have an impact on BTS’s performance or spirit. They thanked their fans for their support and kept putting on amazing shows. They also conveyed their wish for harmony and peace among various fandoms. Even in their song “We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal,” where they animatedly performed in front of a dark stadium that turned purple as they sung about their journey with the ARMY, they made references to the black ocean.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is the meaning of the black ocean?</h2><p>A black ocean is when the audience intentionally disrupts an artist’s performance by turning off their light sticks, leaving the stadium dark and silent. It can be extremely discouraging and hurtful for the artist because it is seen as a show of disrespect, disapproval, or hostility towards them.</p><p>Watch: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_TLuR-D72E</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did girls generation get a black ocean?</h2><p>Popular K-pop girl group Girls’ Generation made its debut in 2007 under SM Entertainment. They have been among the most well-known and prosperous organisations in the field, but they also had to overcome many obstacles and difficulties throughout their careers. The famed Black Ocean event in 2008 was one of them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did seventeen get black ocean?</h2><p>At the 2008 Dream Concert, one of the largest annual concerts in Korea that features many well-known musicians, Girls’ Generation encountered a black&nbsp;ocean. Most of the other artists’ supporters turned off their lightsticks for the whole ten minutes of their performance when they took the stage to perform “Kissing You” and “Girls’ Generation,” creating a black&nbsp;ocean that contrasted with the vibrant lights of their own fans, SONE.</p><p>The competition and animosity between various fandoms, notably those of SM Entertainment’s male groups like Super Junior and TVXQ, is said to be the cause of the “black ocean.” Some fans felt scared by Girls’ Generation’s developing fame and success because they did not like how close they were to their oppas (elder brothers). Another rumour that enraged the ELF (Super Junior’s fans) was that several SONEs tore a Super Junior flag before the show. Additionally, given that Wonder Girls were Girls’ Generation’s main rivals at the time, some audience members yelled their name during their performance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is white ocean in K-pop?</h2><p>The audience turns on their lightsticks&nbsp;to create a cohesive and dazzling stadium as a sign of respect and support for the artist performing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is black card in K-pop?</h2><p>In K-pop, a “black card” is a high-end credit card with no maximum spending restriction that is only made available to those with extremely high net worths. It represents a luxury lifestyle and the extremely wealthy. Only a few K-pop stars, including BTS’s Jin and Jungkook, BLACKPINK’s Jennie, BIGBANG’s G-Dragon and Taeyang, EXO’s Suho, Girls’ Generation’s Taeyeon, and TXT’s Yeonjun, are known to have a black card. If you have a black card in K-pop, it signifies you are one of the most well-known and successful stars there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who in BTS has a Black Card?</h2><p>Jin and Jungkook, two members of BTS, hold a black card. When Jin paid for a lunch to celebrate Suga’s birthday, he was observed using a black card. When Jungkook purchased some food from a vending machine, he was observed using a black card. They both possess the “The Black” of the Hyundai Card, one of the most rare and costly black cards in South Korea.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is the richest idol in K-pop?</h2><p>Kim Jaejoong, who has a net worth of more than $90 million, is the richest idol in K-pop. He is a businessman, actor, director, designer, and singer-songwriter. He is a part of JYJ, a group that was established in 2009 after he left TVXQ. He also has a lucrative solo career and has made investments in a variety of companies, including restaurants, apparel labels, and cosmetics.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does anyone in BTS have a Black Card?</h2><p>Jin and Jungkook, two members of BTS, hold a black card.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.ghgossip.com/who-is-nicole-remy-biographynet-worth-more-brief/>who-is-nicole-remy-biographynet-worth-more-brief/</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfmqxdmbymv4yaZJukkZi4brvCnpinZZ2arq95yKdkraCVYrhuvM6pZJqknGLGsMGO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-a-black-ocean-mean-in-the-k-pop-all-you.html&text=What%20does%20a%20Black%20Ocean%20mean%20in%20the%20K-Pop%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-a-black-ocean-mean-in-the-k-pop-all-you.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-a-black-ocean-mean-in-the-k-pop-all-you.html&title=What%20does%20a%20Black%20Ocean%20mean%20in%20the%20K-Pop%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-does-a-black-ocean-mean-in-the-k-pop-all-you.html&title=What%20does%20a%20Black%20Ocean%20mean%20in%20the%20K-Pop%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-a-black-ocean-mean-in-the-k-pop-all-you.html&title=What%20does%20a%20Black%20Ocean%20mean%20in%20the%20K-Pop%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-a-black-ocean-mean-in-the-k-pop-all-you.html&description=What%20does%20a%20Black%20Ocean%20mean%20in%20the%20K-Pop%20All%20You%20Need%20To%20Know" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./when-did-t-j-lavin-start-hosting-the-challenge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When did T.J.
