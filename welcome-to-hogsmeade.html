with another Troll having appeared, which leaves you and your companion to fight it off together.</span></p><p><span>During the fight, you will need to use dodge to avoid certain attacks, which are shown with a red marker above your character’s head.</span></p><p><span>You will still be able to use Protego for certain attacks but Levioso does not appear to do much against them.</span></p><p><span>During the fight, you will be able to use a new ability which is the Ancient Magic Throw, allowing you to toss objects at the Troll.</span></p><p><span>Continue fighting the troll until its health is low and you will be prompted to finish it off with another new ability, the Activate Ancient Magic ability, which destroys it.</span></p><p><img decoding=async

Hill.</span></p><p><span>A cutscene will play when you speak to him and he will thank you for your help and offer you a reward that you can receive from his shop menu.</span></p><p><span>When the menu

intense knowing that you have been followed by Ranrok, who has taken interest in you.</span></p><p><span>Lucky for you, the people in Hogsmeade took your side and protected you against a man named
