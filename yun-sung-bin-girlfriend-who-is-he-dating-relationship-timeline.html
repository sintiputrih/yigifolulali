Yun made a name for himself in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</span></p><p><span>He dominated the competition, setting a new Olympic record of 3 minutes and 20.55 seconds.

His social media could not reveal anything about his current or previous love affairs. There was no sign of a girlfriend or wife on his social media.</span></p><p><span>The state of Yun’s Sung-relationship bin is unknown. If he was married, he never mentioned it in Physical 100.

Career Explored</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Cho Young-hee, Yun Sung-mother, bin’s has dramatically supported his life and profession. He phoned her as he raced down a 1,335-meter slope in Park City, Utah, in his senior year of high school, when he sobbed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>His mother recalls how astonished she was when her son, who never expressed his actual thoughts even in the face of tragedy, phoned with such hesitation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Think it over one more time and then decide on what you want to accomplish. “I will always respect your choice,” she had promised.</span></p><p><span>Looking back on her son’s life, the grandmother reportedly told Korea JoongAng Daily that she had learned much from him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She used to think of him as just her kid, but after a while, he realized he also represented the country. She exclaimed that she believed she was maturing thanks to mature Sung-bin.</span></p><p><span>He won his first World Cup gold medal in the seventh round in St. Moritz and a silver in the 2016 IBSF World Championships in Igls, finishing the season in second place overall with one gold, three silver, and two bronze medals.</span></p><p><span>He began skeleton at 18 in early 2012 and won the national championship in September 2012 following a three-month training period.

In addition to the title of “most perfect physique,” if he wins the Physical 100 competition in the first place, he will get a financial award of $300 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In that event, he will be overjoyed, as he was distraught last year when he could not establish Olympic form for the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games.</span></p><p><span>He earned his first World Cup podium in December 2014, taking bronze in Calgary. Yun concluded his first season in sixth position overall in the 2014-15 World Cup standings, earning one silver and two bronze medals.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaLGlo3q0wc2gZJuhnmK0qr7Ln6minZ6Zeri0zmagrGWYmnqlrdOipaBlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlerW1zJ6joqaVZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating-relationship-timeline.html&text=Yun%20Sung%20Bin%20Girlfriend%3a%20Who%20Is%20He%20Dating%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating-relationship-timeline.html&title=Yun%20Sung%20Bin%20Girlfriend%3a%20Who%20Is%20He%20Dating%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating-relationship-timeline.html&title=Yun%20Sung%20Bin%20Girlfriend%3a%20Who%20Is%20He%20Dating%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating-relationship-timeline.html&title=Yun%20Sung%20Bin%20Girlfriend%3a%20Who%20Is%20He%20Dating%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyun-sung-bin-girlfriend-who-is-he-dating-relationship-timeline.html&description=Yun%20Sung%20Bin%20Girlfriend%3a%20Who%20Is%20He%20Dating%3f%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kevin-hart-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Hart Net Worth: Cars &amp;amp; Charity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-terence-crawfords-wife-alindra-person.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Terence Crawfords Wife Alindra Person?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
